CMV: We should stop doing widespread news coverage on mass shootings (school shootings to be specific).,TiredTransLesbian,1166,2023-04-01 19:13:32,
,3xtheredcomet,45,2023-04-01 22:38:02,"One youtuber I used to watch a lot, Philip Defranco, covers the news including mass shootings, but his policy is to never mention the killer by name nor put their picture on screen.

I feel like that's a decent compromise, what do you think?"
,Screezleby,1,2023-04-02 21:25:43,"This seems ideal. You can't censor the event successfully, but you can take away the killer's fame."
,Ok_Try_1217,46,2023-04-01 23:07:07,"One of the biggest sparks in the movement for black rights in the US was the murder of 14 year-old Emit Till. His mother insisted on a public funeral service with an open casket saying, “let the people see what they did to my boy.” Tens of thousands attended his funeral and images of his bloated, mutilated body were published in black-oriented magazines and newspapers, rallying popular black support and white sympathy across the U.S.

In the Uvalde shooting, a pediatrician who attended to the victims [described](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/09/uvalde-chief-pete-arredondo-interview/) small bodies “pulverized” and “decapitated.” Image seeing the images of the bodies of little children like that on the TV instead of just coverage of outside and people crying. Maybe that’s too extreme but, bottom line, I don’t think the way to lessen school shootings is to hide the problem. If anything, the horrendous effects need to be substantially amplified so that more action will be taken to prevent it."
,[deleted],2,2023-04-02 19:48:31,"I have to agree with this. The victims of shootings are always depicted with smiling family photos, like that charming 9 year old just went to sleep and didn't wake up. I think confronting people with the visceral reality of what a shot-up child looks like is the only way to move public opinion at this point.

ETA: Some of the most famous and powerful photos we have are of violence being done to children, to the point that they remain powerful even decades later. [Phan Thi Kim Phuc aka ""Napalm Girl""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Thi_Kim_Phuc) and [an Oklahoma City firefighter carrying the body of Baylee Almon](https://apps.bostonglobe.com/special-projects/2022/10/road-trip-america/the-photo-of-an-oklahoma-city-bombing-victim-ill-never-forget) are *still* referenced today."
,NoTeslaForMe,2,2023-04-04 00:39:39,"The fact that it worked in one case in the 68 years ago but not for decades of school shootings shows you that it ""working"" was an anomaly.  Coverage of these shootings glorifies the shooter (in spite of media trying hard to do so less than in the past) and gives the public an distorted view of what gun-related deaths and other events in the U.S. look like.  And any outrage isn't going to get the masses to change their philosophies about gun rights, just inflame already entrenched positions.  I wouldn't go as far as OP, but OP is right about the coverage being more harmful than helpful."
,Ok_Try_1217,0,2023-04-04 00:55:22,I’m sorry but which of the decades of school shootings showed the carnage of the aftermath like [this](https://imgur.com/a/rlXojgi)?
,abx99,84,2023-04-01 19:42:15,"It's important to know that things like this are happening. If they don't, then there will be nothing but resistance to anything you want to do to fix the problem. Why spend money on reforms for some issue you never even hear about? At the very least (best), it drops way down the list of priorities.

However, if they focus the coverage on the victims, and less on the perpetrator, would draw a lot more attention to the actual tragedy of the problem. These news stories affect people, and focusing less on the perpetrator and more on the victims would change how these are perceived. Right now the deaths are largely abstract to anyone not directly affected by them.

There's a lot of controversy about the photos they should show. Some think that they should show the victims, others think that's too much and would be too traumatizing. I tend to think that there's an in-between in which they could show the aftermath without showing any actual death.

This is actually an old debate. One of the most influential pictures about the Vietnam war is said to be a general executing a VC prisoner taken by Eddie Adams. Read about it here: [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42864421](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42864421)"

~~I completely agree with this.~~ I'm not sure I completely agree with this. I'm in the picture is worth a 1000 words camp. I think the brutality should be shown in full force. Parents of shooting victims that want to ban guns should be posting their kid's damaged bodies all over the media.

Emmett Til's mother knew that photos would work. She made sure her son's funeral was open casket. She wanted those photos of his mangled face to be published. She wanted people to be outraged.

Unicef knows this too. Photos of children in distress are the reason Unicef ads work as well as they do. I can't imaging Unicef would have as many donations if they used text.

Martin Luther King knew photos would work too. His protests were not just about protesting. They were about showing the brutality of jim crow laws."
,sarahelizam,4,2023-04-02 05:58:05,"Absolutely agree, especially on the part about the Civil Rights Movement. People have completely lost their understanding of what made the Civil Rights Movement effective. It wasn’t pretty words, which helped tie together the ideas of people already receptive to the message. It was the mass, visceral display of state brutality that brought the violence out of the shadows and onto the front pages and TVs of white moderates who had otherwise been able to hide from the system they were complicit in. 

Same with Rosa Parks. She wasn’t the first black woman to refuse to sit at the back of the bus - she was handpicked to be a model citizen who could inspire empathy. The news wasn’t there by happenstance. Every effective revolutionary movement of the last century knew how to utilize new media to create a narrative around their struggle. Because facts don’t change minds in areas where emotions dominate (tbh most of politics at this point). Telling a better story than the one people have been fed. That may culminate in speeches, but to get to the point they can be effective to a broader audience (not just those already in support of the cause) messaging through news media must be employed. 

We have been taught propaganda and told that groups like the Black Panthers got in the way of Civil Rights, a complete lie that ignores their role. Revolutionary movements can only make change within an existing government structure if the alternative (do nothing and deal with those with more radical positions who have little to lose) is more disruptive than making minor concessions. Because that’s what the Civil Rights Act was - a minor concession. When we talk about this movement our perceptions have been so warped by both the whitewashing and the smearing (thank you FBI and the US of A cultural hegemony in general). We have been defanged as a population, housebroken to believe that change can only come from voting, permitted protests, and civil discourse. But this is choosing the negative peace, that absence of conflict, over the positive peace of justice that MLK spoke about. Civility politics is trash when faced with a system in which incrementalism is a constant compromise to do less for the people with interests who seek to do active harm. 

We need to be reminded viscerally of the problems we face, and not just shootings. The horror of dying in a health are system that will not spare you a thought unless you pay. The reality of homelessness. Only then can we organize enough people to commit to permitted civic and direct actions that will actually address these issues. Of course the way we report on some things is important, as in the case with suicides. But we do need to address suicides and shootings and hate groups as symptoms of problems that go ignored. The mental wellness of young men especially goes overlooked by all sides and based on how we understand radicalization we can’t afford to ignore their needs. 

End rant lol"

,Trucker2827,1,2023-04-01 22:09:10,"Also not sure exactly what I think. 

On the other hand, you had thousands of families come out to see lynchings throughout the South and go entirely unpunished. It was even enjoyable to them, so there’s also a risk of normalizing really dark violence. 

I think in the past, when it was easier to ignore the world’s problems and hardly see what happens outside of your community, photos and TV were big deals in getting some of these movements going. But then, you have to consider desensitization from overexposure more recently since people are constantly seeing violent issues. And people are definitely burnt out of seeing constant mass shootings. 

Maybe it’ll even be easier for people to discuss mental health and gun control policies if we stop covering the details of the tragedies that depress people from engaging."

Such a ban also would take away the public's right to know what dangers are facing the country. Democracies can only work proprerly when the public can know what issues need to be solved. If the public doesn't know that school shootings are a problem they won't vote for the anti-gun candidate. 

If we ban the news about mass shootings it allows a great argument that we should ban news reporting on other subjects in the name of prevention or public safety. We could ban news about police shootings because it leads to riots. We could ban news about train accidents to prevent panic. . . ."

,xtaberry,96,2023-04-02 00:54:42,"But in the USA, you have guidance against covering certain activities in detail because coverage inspires copy-cats. Suicides, for instance: although they can be covered, there is supposed to be no discussion of methods, there is guidance about avoiding sensationalist headlines or speaking about a suicide ""epidemic"" or ""crisis"", and there is advice against interviewing first responders or family members. Reporters are told to speak about the victims life, not dwell on the act of suicide, and provide resources as a part of the news segment.

This isn't law - mostly, it comes from organizations like the Foundation for Suicide Prevention who makes suggestions and news outlets who implement them voluntarily. I don't understand why the USA doesn't have something similar for school shootings. There needs to be less dramatization, and less child victims being put in front of the world to discuss their unprocessed trauma. The life of the victims should be honored first and foremost, and the identity of the shooter or how they did it or with which gun should not be the topic of public discourse."

,AndySocks,9,2023-04-02 06:52:48,"No you’re right, since it seems inevitable for the media to not cover a school/mass shooting, we need to at least change the way we cover shootings on the news.

Take what was reported once the media outlets got hold of the security footage from the Nashville event. They showed the shooter walking through the school hallways with gun in hand. Imagine some troubled kid at home watching that, with envy in his eyes and an AR half locked in his dad’s basement.

Until we can figure out a way to prevent access to these weapons of war, we can at least try to not put these shooters in the spotlight. This will be difficult but it’s like they say: “If it bleeds, it leads.”"

a few years ago in Boston there were and there were a spate of young, gay men ending up in the harbor and the news never said what it was or how they died. I think it was informativity without sensationalism. don't know if it was a killer or not but it was something weird going on.

>But one difficulty implementing such inform rules is that a large fraction of the population believe that mass shootings are due to mental instability of the shooter, and have nothing to do with acess to firearms.

I disagree. People **say** that's what they believe. But anyone who believes toddlers and terrorists shouldn't be allowed to have guns is acknowledging that (1) guns are designed to be the most efficient way to hurt or kill people, and (2) gun control -- keeping guns away from people who pose a danger, intentionally or not, to themselves or others -- is therefore necessary.

It's highly unlikely that this would actually happen, but if news outlets are willing to put people's lives into consideration rather than clicks, I think the right approach for them would be to stop covering these stories.

2020 only saw 20 deaths, probably thanks to COVID. But 2018 saw 61 deaths.

So in recent years, ignoring covid, over 50 children per year get killed and many more get injured or traumatized as a result of gunfire incidents in the United States.

Could you consider conceding that other solutions exist that don't require further restrictions in US law, and have been demonstrated to work? Everyone agrees the continually repeating tragedies need to end, and I think most would agree that it should happen as fast as possible. Ridding a country of 350+ million people with more firearms than people seems unrealistic, especially when considering the willingness of states to help in that goal.

I assume for this next part you hold a perspective open to policies like welfare. Countries have demonstrated that they can have proportionally high gun ownership with disproportionally low rates of gun homicide when compared the US. Switzerland, Czechia, and Finland are some of a few countries that have these high rates of ownership with low violence, with similar restrictions (if not less in some cases) as states in the US. Social welfare across the board lowers crime. Crime (That isn't the actual homicide itself, i.e. robbery) is the cause of a majority of gun homicides. Access to social welfare differentiates these countries from the US which allows them to trust its citizenry to be armed (Or in the case of Switzerland, tell its citizenry to be armed). These countries also have judiciaries much more lenient and rehabilitation focused, and more ""gun culture"" that revolves around education (like middle school rifle clubs),.

And in the meantime, children get slaughtered. While people stand around discussing welfare, the welfare of children in schools gets forgotten.

It's very difficult to compare the mindset of other countries. Better to compare like with like.

The states in America that have the strictest gun laws have the lowest murders via guns, correct?

People do not need rapid-fire guns. That is what shooters are mostly bringing into schools, correct?

Kids deserve our protection, correct? We're failing them and allowing their slaughter, correct?

Any rebuttal to the premise that countries with similar gun laws to the US are able to have less homicide? That is the core of my suggestion. You cannot say to change ""X"" before we can do a comparison if ""X"" is an independent variable that stays the same for the comparison. You are using a circular argument here, the point *is* that the US laws aren't incongruent with low gun homicide.

Also your source doesn't rebut that [high gun ownership countries](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/178/proportion_of_households_with_firearms/194,49,65,136) can have [low gun homicide](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/178/rate_of_gun_homicide/49,194,136,65).

,Im_Daydrunk,2,2023-04-02 09:39:10,"IMO Switzerland has a lot that seperates it even from a civilian happiness standpoint and shouldn't be used as an example to support the US not needing to deal with their gun issues

The Swiss for example have much stricter gun laws (including it not being allowed to just carry the guns wherever you go), guns aren't worshiped like they are in the USA, and most of those guns are former service weapons and the people who have them went through extensive training with them. Also the Swiss don't fight in wars or have widespread desire for killing/using weapons to attack other countries. They tend to see guns as purely a tool to defend themselves in the absolute worst case scenario and take pride in competitions that turn guns more into sporting equipment 

The USA, seperate from their poor social welfare/mental health care, has a dangerously obsessive relationship with guns to the point where many people who want to have guns actively fantasize about using guns to kill people in ""justifed"" ways. I feel that even if you were to magically fix a lot of the underlying social issues the US would still have lots of gun deaths because many people bring them into situations that no country (even one with a lot of guns like the Swiss) would support. They are treated as a vital part of being an American and not as a tool that should only be used if absolute required

So I do think the accessibility of guns for untrained people and how they are viewed in the US absolutely play a major part to the violence we have. Its not just poor people failed by the system or inadequate mental health treatments IMO"

That's the point, that a society that embraces social welfare, prison rehabilitation, etc. can have low homicide (overall). Comparing US states misses any significant differences in social welfare and prisoner rehabilitation. While states with stricter gun law may have slightly less gun homicide, it is not [as pronounced as the difference between societies with different support systems.](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/178/rate_of_gun_homicide/49,136,194,288,331,320,304) (over 18x less gun homicides in Switzerland than New York, and Switzerland has less restrictive gun laws than New York. Compare this to the 2.6x decrease from Texas to New York, Texas being a state with slightly less restrictive gun laws than Switzerland)

>I mean, if you want to compare other countries, then you could compare countries whose citizens have few guns, like Australia, and see how many school shootings or mass shootings they have. There is your independent variable

The independent variable is gun ownership laws. Other countries have similar laws. The dependent variable is gun homicide. It is lower in those other countries.

No, the experiment can only be held in the USA. Like with like. And it is being held. There is more than enough data. Compare Hawaii with the Southern states, for starters.

>Comparing to Australia misses the point entirely, except for it being another society with better social welfare that results in lower overall crime.

I'm afraid you don't know the history. The gun laws came into effect due to a mass shooting in 1996. After the guns were taken away en masse-- no more mass shootings. It's now a safe country where there has never been a school shooting and no one would have cause to worry about a mass shooting in the streets.

No change in social welfare, prisoner rehab etc etc. Just quick, bold, brave gun laws.

>over 18x less gun homicides in Switzerland than New York, and Switzerland has less restrictive gun laws than New York.

Again, you cannot compare these two places. New York suffers from the terrible gun laws in other states. They can't stop guns from being bought in from weak states that have weak gun laws.

Hawaii benefits from being a state that isn't as easy to bring in guns from across borders, as it's an island state. It also benefits from its much stronger gun laws."

What? Why would I compare those things if they aren't relevant to my thesis? You are misunderstanding my thesis so read the next part with an open mind to reconsider your perspective:  


I am not saying gun laws are ineffective. I am stating alternative solutions exist and are shown to work.   


The European countries are being used as examples of places with similar gun laws and ownership rates, but exponentially less gun homicide and crime. **Do you know why this is?**

The meth head most probably wants to steal, not harm the lady. By the time she finds her gun and gets it ready to shoot, the risk to her is greater than if she didn't confront the intruder. And if she shoots and misses, then the meth addict might choose to kill her.

What are ""rights""? Some words on a piece of paper written back when guns were nothing like they are today?

>No, because that’s illegal and is not a valid tool for self defense.

Why is it illegal? What if I want to walk about with my DBU bomb & intimidate people? What if I want to stash bombs at my house in case of intruders? What about my bomb rights?

Such as?

Or we could just protect the most important thing on the planet (aka kids) with armed security the same way we do useless old fuck politicians and businessmen.

Not just old ladies to be clear, women of all ages who are at a huge physical disadvantage to their attackers, and it happens way more often than you’d realize.  Most people aren’t aware of the number of DGU’s, because the fascist elites who are trying to disarm us, don’t like those instances being highlighted.

>	And yeah, being robbed is nothing like being attacked. It isn’t.

That’s a strawman.  I was just pointing out how insane it is to pretend that it’s ok that they just cower in fear and pray that luck is on their side, while someone rifles through their valuable (often irreplaceable) possessions.

>	Those are the tired phrases of people who don’t really care about what happens to other people,

No, anti gunners just get upset when someone points out their fascism isn’t actually a solution.  Or if anyone uses facts and statistics to form their opinion instead of the fear, disinformation, and attempts to prey on emotions that are relied upon by the elites and their puppets.

>	What are “rights”? Some words on a piece of paper written back when guns were nothing like they are today?

Yikes.  First off, that’s as silly as pretending you shouldn’t be able to say what you want on your phone because they never could have envisioned that technology…  Secondly, you are wrong, there were firearms at the time that utilized multiple barrels to fire multiple projectiles, auto loading, literal cannons, etc.  And lastly but most importantly, you realize the constitution doesn’t *give* us our rights, right?  It just recognizes they exist, whether the constitution does or not.  They’re inalienable.

>	Why is it illegal?

Because it is not a tool that can be used for self defense, and is only used to cause destruction.  Speaking of tho, you really think that if you somehow magically banned guns, these sick fucks would just stop attacking people.  Or would they just use other inanimate objects like in the bath school massacre or all the truck attacks in other instances (that caused way more death and destruction)?

Oh, I do know. It's usually a male who is known to them who attacks them - those are the clear stats. As happened to me at the hands of a husband. I've also had my house robbed about 3 times. Yes, it's painful, but it's nothing compared with being attacked physically. And when women are shot, it's usually a male who is known to them -- a boyfriend, husband or ex. You cannot be armed at all times against someone you live with, but they are the people most dangerous to you.

>Or if anyone uses facts and statistics to form their opinion instead of the fear,

Fear is an interesting thing. It's easy not to be concerned when you are among the groups least likely to be the victim of the thing being spoken about.

>They’re inalienable

So you think.

>Speaking of tho, you really think that if you somehow magically banned guns, these sick fucks would just stop attacking people.

Obviously the answer to that is ""no"". I have already said a couple of times that we need to keep schools secure and not allow people in unchecked.

>Because it is not a tool that can be used for self defense

I'm pretty certain no one will come near me if I have a hand grenade. That's self defence. I'm also pretty sure people shouldn't be walking around with objects that can kill and maim many others within a space of seconds.

Sorry to hear that.  I wish you and my mom, and my sister, and every woman who has ever been beat, had a gun on them.

My personal experiences are different.  But tbf I was a kid at that time and had gotten pretty used to getting beat.

But the point is tho, none of that should happen.  And if it does, the criminal should be taught a lesson.

That’s why we should fight the propaganda and the obstacles that contribute to a culture of unarmed women.

Not with that attitude (I’m joking… mostly).  But that’s why you arm yourself to get out of that situation, not stay in it.

>	It’s easy not to be concerned when you are among the groups least likely to be the victim of the thing being spoken about.

You have no clue what you’re talking about.  I would bet everything I have that I’ve lost more loved ones to gun violence than you.

Not when taking innocent people out with you could’ve been prevented.

You realize trucks (like the one used in Nice, France) are responsible for some of the worst mass killings we’ve seen, right?  Should those be banned too?

>	While children get slaughtered, people argue about “mah alienable rights!”

Agreed, it’s pathetic that we have to go on the defensive because the fascist elites (not calling you that to be clear, I think you believe you’re actually doing the right thing) use these tragedies to attack the law abiding and strip rights, instead of us all figuring out actual solutions (like the one you mentioned about preventing unauthorized access)."

,Plazmatic,8,2023-04-02 00:17:34,"First, I support assault weapons bans or things like it.  But this is something at least some gun advocates are not entirely wrong about. Assault weapon is a legal term, and legally differs from state to state.  The ability for a state to define an assault weapon is part of what was included in the initial assault weapon ban.  And contrary to what people say, only *federal* bans on assault weapons were lifted, which used [it's own definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon#:~:text=Drawing%20from%20federal%20and%20state,one%20or%20more%20other%20features.):

> ""In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use.""

Which *was*  less arbitrary than what many states consider assault weapons, despite the still vague wording (IMO, it's probably closer to what you and I think an assault weapon actually is). 

But other states, like California, have a different list of features: https://giffords.org/lawcenter/state-laws/assault-weapons-in-california/

> * A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and at least one of the following additional features:
(1) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;
(2) a thumbhole stock;
(3) a folding or telescoping stock;
(4) a grenade or flare launcher;
(5) a flash suppressor; or
(6) a forward pistol grip;17

> * A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than ten rounds;

> * A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that has an overall length of less than 30 inches;

> * A semiautomatic pistol that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and any one of the following: 1) a threaded barrel, capable of accepting a flash suppressor, forward handgrip, or silencer; 2) a second handgrip; 3) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the barrel allowing the bearer to fire the weapon without burning his or her hand, except a slide that encloses the barrel; or 4) the capacity to accept a detachable magazine at some location outside of the pistol grip;

> * A semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than ten rounds;

> * A semiautomatic shotgun that has both a folding or telescoping stock, and a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon, thumbhole stock, or vertical handgrip;

> * A semiautomatic shotgun that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine;

> * A shotgun with a revolving cylinder; or

> * A semiautomatic centerfire firearm that is not technically a rifle, pistol, or shotgun, if it either has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds, has an overall length of less than 30 inches, or does not have a fixed magazine but has at least one of the features associated with assault weapons, as described above.18

Notice how there's a lot more specificity here. But also there's rules like ""A semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than ten rounds"".   Some of the most popular *pistols* in the world right now accept *multiple* magazines that far exceed 10 rounds. https://blog.refactortactical.com/blog/10-most-popular-handguns/.  This effectively bans many *normal pistols*.   My understanding is there's other oddities about these rules that make things difficult as well for certain non problematic situations, but someone else will have to expand on those.  This is what gun owners start to get mad about, some of the rules end up seeming arbitrary. 

News media also constantly calls otherwise nominal pistols or other non ""assaulty"" weapons by definition, ""assault weapons"", or similarly scary terms.   Gun subreddits are full of examples of media making otherwise normal function, a common one is ""semi-automatic"".  Virtually all modern pistols are ""semi-automatic"", semi-automatic corresponds to the fact that you don't have to manually load bullets into the gun, you squeeze the trigger and the next bullet gets loaded in automatically then you squeeze again, and it fires, and the next bullet comes in, not ""burst fire/ fully automatic fire"".  Yet the word is wielded in a way to make you think ""Something that doesn't shoot quite as long as a fully automatic assault rifle"". 

Now some gun nuts will claim there's a ""media bias against guns"" when the *actual* bias is that media will try to get the most views/clicks, which sensationalism does, and not some illuminati anti second amendment cult like they act.  Media is ambivalent to guns themselves."

I don't agree on your overall opinion on gun control, but I agree with this statement. In my opinion this resentment towards the media stems from (as you said) their inherent business model *and also* lack of education/understanding on the complicated topic that is firearms.

Firearms have existed for 735 years, and the US Federal government has had laws on them for 89 years. These law's foundation was the tax code and enforced by the Department of Treasury.

I 100% agree with doing this first. As I've already said in this discussion. Secure the schools. Not one child should die at the hands of a killer coming into a school, no matter what the killer's plan of attack is.

>It will not be possible to remove millions of guns from the streets.

No. But the gun restrictions put in place in states such as Hawaii show what's possible and how everyone can be safer.

>This Supreme Court will strike down any assault weapons ban.

They've been banned before and can be banned again. And the supreme court can come to their senses. Just because they're not small children who don't have a voice and just because they are among a group least likely to ever die via a gun attack, doesn't mean they can't wake up.

>These shootings are increasing because of contagion and how easy they are to perpetrate.

Contagion doesn't explain why they're almost all young white males who are the school shooters. It has to be a number of factors, including how guns are marketed to young men."

There has been a lot of actual research done on this subject, called mass shooting contagion theory. 149 researchers and law enforcement actually [wrote an open letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4Z7VkWcwLk-SjFJc00tdmI1eW8/view?resourcekey=0-hj8_5Jdjyej8UI_7lvrSKw) encouraging the media to stop making shooters famous. 

Fame-seeking is now a common motive among mass shooters, having grown appreciably since about 2000. Fame seekers tend to be younger and to have about double the average victim count. Fame-seeking mass shooters also tend to get more media coverage, thus fulfilling their goal.

That is, violent media in children has been shown to lead to violence in those same kids as they grow into teenagers, but that hasn’t been shown in adults.

ACLU: ""Over 230 schools reported school shootings. However, two school districts mistakenly reported each of their schools as having a shooting. The data from these two districts accounted for 63 of the reported shootings.  

Everytown Research, a nonprofit organization, reports that less than 30 school shootings occurred in K-12 settings during the 2015-16 school year, a far cry from the nearly 240 reported by the Trump administration.

,The_White_Ram,9,2023-04-01 21:36:04,"Exactly. It's also the case with mass shootings and how those are reported.

The problem with having a discussion about mass shootings in the United States is that no one is really on the same page as to what the definition is. My perception is that the term ""mass shooting"" is commonly and colloquially associated with a lone wolf individual who goes on a shooting spree spontaneously/randomly that wasn't the result of a different criminal act.

Unfortunately there is no fixed definition of a mass shooting in the United States, and different researchers define ""mass shootings"" in different ways. 

For example gunviolence.org which is commonly cited, defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot. In 2019 they reported 417 mass shootings. 

Compare this with the FBI who defined ""Active Shooter Incidents"" similar to how it is colloquially used (lone wolf, spontaneous/random, not a motive associated with a different criminal act), who identifed 28 Active shooter incidents. 
https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-in-the-us-2019-042820.pdf/view

Its important to note that the FBI's definition excluded similar events that were motivated by gang-violence, self defense, drug violence, crossfire as a byproduct of another ongoing criminal act, (several other items).

To me it seems like the large majority of the ""mass shootings"" in the US are the result of pre-existing criminal activity and not the lone wolf type person that people commonly associate with the term ""mass shooting""."

The new definition exists for a reason. It used to not be so complicated. But about ten years ago, the mods of the most rabidly anti-gun sub on Reddit came up with a new expanded definition to pump the numbers up by including common criminal incidents (especially gang on gang). They made a web site about it, that got some media traction, and that web site was later integrated into gunviolence.org. Then the media really latched on to this new scarier definition, and confusion followed.

Obviously they want the attention though. I’m just not sure if people realize that everyone has a platform these days. I hear more and more about crimes being committed on live streaming platforms, photos and videos posted on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, twitter, etc.. and then afterwards everyone flocks to these platforms to find more information. Recently a group of girls around 13 tortured another girl for hours and posted the videos online.

,sapphon,2,2023-04-02 04:02:39,"Your idea is a very old one, at least as old as Egypt's 18th Dynasty and Hapshepsut.  The name people use for your idea in my culture is from more than a thousand years later, because we have a hard-on for the Romans I guess: 'damnatio memoriae', as practiced against Nero and many others.

The idea is, if a person commits crimes against the state, one of the things the state should be able to do, it was reasoned, was deny them their popular fame going forward.  This was attempted to such extent that I think would make even you possibly blanch - historical records were altered, birth and death records destroyed, official documents edited, *artworks defaced*, and *structures destroyed*.  Conspicuously referring to the punished by name in public could see *the speaker punished too*.  The idea was to render it as if this MF *never existed*!  

Chyeah, defy the laws for the sake of your personal fame now, I dare ya.  Right?  It'd be self-defeating.  Except.

The insurmountable problems with our attempting to impose such a punishment ourselves would be at least two.  I've already cheekily revealed one in the scope of this comment, and the other can be developed out of only a grade-school understanding of US civics - the US being where most of these highly publicized mass shootings take place.  Can you guess what the problems are?

* First, *I have provided you examples of individuals so damned*.  Think about that.  If we now know when Nero lived, what Nero did, and that he suffered this punishment and when and why and at whose hands - well, it **cannot have worked**.  It didn't work.  It doesn't work, for the same reason that a police officer cannot just nicely ask passing motorists not to look at an an accident - human curiosity is somewhat morbid.

* Second, US citizens live under capitalism and are very protective of their ""free speech"" - a term that is *not* well understood by them, leading to pejoratives like 'muh freeze peach', but in this case it's an open-and-shut case: the government cannot tell you not to talk about something because it thinks a shooter's memory needs damning.  It legally just can't.  Businesses can deplatform you and private invididuals can try to silence you using their private resources - which is such an enormous power that it might actually be enough, *if* every business colluded with one mind.  That's why I mentioned capital - there's almost always a profit motive for *someone* to provide a minority report, even if most outlets might agree on what's polite to print; we're the country that gave birth to stormfront.org, FFS.

So, liberal democracies don't really have the tools to ""unfamous"" someone to the same extent that historical authorities who tried to do so had; meanwhile, *even those historical attempts failed*, so I'd like to change your view in that the ship for this kind of ham-handed control of information has demonstrably sailed for the moment!

The news salivates when shit like this happens. The more dramatic the better. Controversial? Even better. I have a coworker that absolutely THRIVES on drama and goes running to tattle to the boss on whatever employee made an error. She crows to me, and gets all “upset” but really is enjoying the dramatic results. She will call a customer who is upset and put them on speaker phone so everyone can hear how awful they can be, yet her responses and treatment on,y escalates the issue. What starts as a mild irritation easily fixed by placating and assurances unfolds into this big ordeal where they want her boss’s contact information and now they will send Ring footage, and lawyers are brought up, veiled threats if it happens again…all avoidable with an apology or at minimum an empathetic ear but strong one line response repeated a few times. Many times I’ve calmed an irate customer with a no, but said after I listened, empathized and gently said nope over and over- 

I understand how you feel but unfortunately this is the resolution. 

I get it and wish I had another answer but unfortunately this is the resolution. 

Yes, I’d be upset as well, but unfortunately this is the resolution. 

Newscasters go for the mist inflammatory story, and repeat it ad nauseam. It takes the focus off the real issue; the mental,health crisis we face because no one wants to FIX mental health issue, they want to toss some pills out, or worse, arrest people with mental illness because finding care is impossible. No one wants to do that very difficult job for minimum wage, and that’s all that is offered. The CEO gets the fat check, the workers get hit and spit on and have to get food stamps to survive. No one wants that so they go flip burgers instead for the same wage, without the spit and bruises. 

We have a mental illness crisis. Mentally ill people can’t hold a job, many end up homeless and turn to street drugs to cope. Some lash out out of self defense. Some were abused growing up, either by family or church, or bullies in school, or a sports leader/coach or what have you. 

I can easily list off more than 20 people I know that grew up with some sort of trauma from childhood…and some didn’t cope well after. Public school, private school, sports teams at school or private teams, parents together, divorced, one parent absent, agnostic, atheist, devout, it didn’t matter. Some can process and grow from it, and some are stunted or damaged from it. 

We need to pay attention to the ones that “disappear” into the crowd. We need to hear the silent cry for help. We need to notice, and care more for those who suffer, rather than treat them like trash. 

Guns are just a tool. They are not the problem, mental illness is primary.

,Sweg_lel,2,2023-04-01 22:21:58,"I can sympathize with your concerns and I see some of the rationale behind your view. However I am of the opinion and I will demonstrate that continued and increased coverage is a better approach at tackling gun control in America.  


First off, while it's true that some perpetrators of mass shootings seek infamy, news coverage is essential for the public to understand the gravity of the situation and the need for urgent policy changes. Without widespread coverage, the general public may not realize the extent of the problem, and there would be less pressure on lawmakers to implement gun control measures or other policies to prevent future tragedies.  


Widespread news coverage can contribute to public pressure on lawmakers to implement stricter gun control measures. Without this coverage, there may be less urgency and motivation for legislators to take action. By keeping the issue in the public eye, the media can help maintain the momentum needed for policy changes that could potentially save lives.

Even WITH the coverage we have, this issue has been and continues to get swept under the rug in this country. After Sandy Hook, Uvalde and countless others we are STILL desensitized to children being slaughtered in a place where they should be safe. If we could see what the responders saw the horrifying reality of this would call more people to action than less.  


Secondly, the media has a responsibility to report on significant events, including mass shootings. What you are proposing is impossible in the first place because you can not restrict the press in the USA. However, news organizations should adopt responsible reporting practices that minimize the risk of inspiring copycats. For instance, they can avoid sharing the shooter's name or face, avoid sensationalism, and focus on facts and prevention measures rather than speculation."
,GenderDimorphism,3,2023-04-01 19:47:14,The downside to that is then I can't use school shootings to push for political agendas that I had before the shooting even happened. Everything is fair game when it comes to politics.

,AggravatingTartlet,0,2023-04-01 23:17:07,"I don't think not reporting it would work.

Because I'm unsure if it's fame most school shooters want. I think they carry out shootings to cause maximum, lasting pain to a whole community, because they feel pain and want others to feel it, too. They often want to die, and know their death at the hands of police will cause their families pain, too -- so that forms part of it. They'll never get to enjoy any ""fame"" because they won't be alive to see it.

Some groups in society tend to inflict pain on others when they feel pain - and boys & men do this far more than girls and women. Girls and women tend to take pain in and keep it inside and hurt themselves. (In general - I do not mean to talk about all boys/men and all girls/women here)

School shootings have very, lasting widespread effects. It's not only about the victims who were shot. Schools are close communities. So every child in a school that had a shooter -- especially the kids who witnessed it -- will carry lifelong effects. That goes for the teachers and everyone else who works or volunteers at schools, too.  
  
And then there's the siblings and families of the child victims and their whole communities and towns. They all bear the mark and trauma of each school shooting.

The United States has 120.5, almost 4 times as many as Switzerland and 10 times as Czech. The reason Finland and Switzerland are even that high is because of mandatory military service for male citizens. The government is literally encouraging them to own and maintain a firearm.

>I have been to three of those four countries and I can tell you they are all very far away from having gun ownership normalized the way it is in the US

I beg to differ, at least from my anecdotal experience having Swiss relatives. Swiss  (and German) people are more private, they would not announce it. [Switzerland still has child/teen gun clubs that are state-sponsored and their shooting sports federation is their 4th largest.](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/gun-fun_switzerland--where-five-year-olds-learn-to-shoot/44018466) Sport shooting in the US is nowhere near as popular in the US as it is in Switzerland. That is about as normalized as normal can get IMO.

If you are commenting on the overall US gun culture I do concur that is wildly different, and I only theorize that it is due to the political polarization of firearms. (As a result of the US system of lobbying and the NRA) However, no empirical data I've seen has drawn a link between the US gun culture and things like gun homicide or death.

>Not only that, guns owned by citizens in the United States have on average more fire power than in those other countries

Also, anecdotally I beg to differ (Switzerland literally gave half of its population military rifles for decades if not centuries lol) and some further elaboration would be appreciated.

For example, it could have an unintended third result of the problem not being covered at all so people think it went away when it didn't."
,Cats_Riding_Dragons,1,2023-04-02 06:53:36,"Or you know, couldn’t we just skip all that and simply say that news outlets should avoid showing the perpetrators face and name. No fame for them and you dont have to overstep so much."
,lemongay,1,2023-04-02 07:07:13,"While your first point is somewhat reasonable, I want to remind you in regards to banning all guns:
Gun control originated as a form to suppress tired minority voices, like yours as a trans lesbian (im also trans and queer). The Black Panther Party was a really historically important civil rights (and importantly, leftist) group. The NRA helped pass the Mulford Act, in response to the Panthers movement. The NRA back then was completely fine with taking away guns as long as it was from minorities. Sound familiar? Look at the state of right wing media right now. Fellow queer person, I shouldn’t have to spell this out to you: the politicians who consider passing gun control don’t care to stop school shootings. That would require a comprehensive expansion of  mental healthcare, something they and their lobbyists have zero intention to pass. 

Gun control in American history is a mechanism to prevent minorities from self defense. The south is likely trying to get transgender defined as a mental illness again, to stop the arming of trans people."

,aski3252,1,2023-04-02 07:51:41,">what do you think the people committing these deplorable acts want? The answer is fame

Not all of them want fame, it's a bit more complicated. Some want revenge, for some it's just a suicide with extra steps, some claim political reasons, etc.

This is most likely never going to happen.

This is also most likely never going to happen.. Both of those scenarios are virtually impossible.

I'm from europe. There is no easy solution, there is no one step fix. People in America are dealing with so many different issues, something like people killing themselves or killing others for no clear benefit or incentive, is at the end of the day, as teerible as it sounds, a symptom.

Instead of trying to find solutions for issues, it seem like the goal is to do endless debates which can never be resolved so that nothing ever happens."
,Lockdanon14,1,2023-04-02 09:15:10,"Meh, they will continue to publicize school shooting as long as it can be a political tool."
,Hemingwavy,1,2023-04-02 10:20:38,You know what happens after mass attacks in other countries? Wall to wall coverage by the media. Why do you think they don't have copycats if the media is driving this?

,Doomsday1080,1,2023-04-02 12:34:54,"I think we just change the way we report it.

1. Your real name will not be used. You will only be referred to by a silly/humorous nickname. ""Following up on the mass shooting done by the needle-dick shooter...""
2. You leave a manifesto, we're saying it's the opposite of what you wrote. You started shooting cause you were against gays, you were super-gay. Etc."
,StarChild413,1,2023-04-02 18:47:58,"That just assumes that A. people dumb enough to commit those kinds of shootings wouldn't be smart enough in other ways to game the system and e.g. write a manifesto that's the opposite of what they believe so the news reverses the reverse and airs their real beliefs and B. every shooter is the same kind of uber-masculine ""alpha"" heterosexual male who would be humiliated by the same things (there's a lot of arguments on r/crazyideas boiling down to just various forms of ""call the shooters gay"" and my response to them is if they're already crazy enough to do such a shooting some homosexual male shooter might do one as a way of coming out to an otherwise bigoted area or w/e as ""this is a way I can make them call me gay"")"
,Doomsday1080,1,2023-04-02 19:33:41,"Valid point. Correction: if you leave a manifesto it will not be acknowledged. Aside from police or any other interested party for investigation or court purposes, it'll be as though you never wrote one.

But if one of OP's original comments is about fame, let's make it work against them. But like you said, if they're crazy, they're crazy. Won't matter what you do."
,Daotar,1,2023-04-02 15:12:32,Of course the same people might see this as a challenge and try for ever bigger shootings in the hopes that one news show will break and cover them. I don’t think you can meaningfully impact gun violence by simply ignoring it.

,Euphoric-Beat-7206,1,2023-04-02 16:46:52,"We should still cover them as that is news, but we should stop naming the perpetrators, and showing photos of the perpetrators and their manuscripts. They should always have their face blurred and we should treat it like it is a picture of Allah that could offend Muslims as in not showing them. The infamy that they gain could be one motive for the crimes they commit. Cut the infamy and you cut some of the motives."
,phoenixthekat,1,2023-04-02 16:51:55,">Ask yourself, what do you think the people committing these deplorable acts want?

You can make an argument the Columbine kids did it for fame. Almost every other person did it because they were mentally ill. It's not for fame. 

>Bottom line: I think the most logical solution would just be to ban firearms all together. While that wouldn't 100% fix everything, as I believe people with such ill minds would find some other way to cause such a damage that will then be repeated

So, you admit your ""solution"" isn't a solution but still you want to deny me my basic human right to defend myself and my property?"
,aimardastrevas,1,2023-04-02 19:35:07,Ofc. That would not encourage other people to do a mass shoot. I've been saying this for quite a while

Have you given any serious thought to the logistics of doing this? Pretend for a second that the second amendment was repealed or interpreted such that there is no longer an individual right to own guns. 40% of American households and 30% of adult individuals own guns. There are literally more guns than people in the United States, over 300 million of them. The vast majority of gun owners are not going to give them up voluntarily. In fact, you will create a MASSIVE black market for guns. Prohibition has not really ever worked well.

For those that will not voluntarily give up their guns, are you going to have swat teams breaking down their doors to take them? You would need more swat teams that are currently in existence and they would have to be incredibly well armed and trained. Many people would die. 

The existence of guns in the US is a foregone conclusion for anyone who acknowledges reality. We are just going to have to figure out how to manage it."
