She easily could have got a glock, and simply put a bullet in her brain in the privacy of her own bedroom if she wanted to end her own life... but instead she decided to engage in a CRAZY and MORE CRAZY act, arguably the worst act possible in a civilized 1st world Western society.

> If she truly believed Christians were trying to genocide transgenders, why would she assist them by killing herself?

Because the shooter is an insane dickwad.

I just believe the act is inherently narcissistic, there are text messages alleged to have been sent by the shooter to a close friend moments before the shooting, and I forgot to mention I read these before stating I believe she was behaving narcissistically by doing this act, in one of the messages she mentions being on the news which to me signals she was seeking attention instead of just killing herself in her room, or somewhere remote where she harms no one else.

,knicksyankeesGoT,1,2023-03-28 13:42:37,"Most people do not struggle with suicide so when I say normal, I mean that the majority of people do not experience life in the same way as those who struggle with said ideation.

Our brains normally have a mechanism hardwired for self-preservation. A breakdown in how one responds to adversity/pain or if it doesn't have a general response can be a major factor for those who struggle with suicide. I'm not a neurologist, so I don't know what causes it, but we're speaking generally. 

My speculation, since everything is epigenetic, is that the environment we've cultivated and currently live in has changed too fast for our brains to adapt. Such rapid changes around us can create new issues as well as compound existing ones. Sure, there are plenty of amenities and things fixed that have tremendous benefits and upside. What comes up is that there are perhaps non-obvious issues that were both unknown and unpredictable that we now face regardless of how we got here. Summing it up, there's always been factors that triggered someone to be more susceptible to suicide, but our ultra connected lives now could be triggering a higher % of people now than in the past for external reasons.

If we take what I'm saying above as plausible, it could lead to not only suicidal ideation but a whole mess of normative ethics being ""dismissed"" that normal heads take for granted. The event highlights some of this, suicidal ideation perhaps lead them to view themselves as already dead, and thus only an actor for a moral cause/crusade. 

""I'm already ""dead,"" but there's still things that mattered to me when I was ""alive."" My body can be a vessel for change since I'm already gone.""

Now, this is a crude and generic way to frame what I'm getting at. One shouldn't be so quick to throw their life away for causes, but we can imagine there would be people (loved ones/parents/children) or things (sovereignty/private property/personal freedoms) that one might consider giving their life to protect. However, if there's an inability/dysfunction to distinguish what hits that bar (normatively), there can be a lot of really bad consequences of the charged political environment we're currently in.

When liberals try to make it seem that genocide is occurring when it isn't, or when conservatives try to make it seem like there's an invasion happening when there isn't, there's going to be people, admittedly small %, whom view this as a call to action. They can already view themselves as ""dead"" and only as a tool to further a moral crusade they feel is just.

All of this to say, those who commit suicide can be brave, assuming they do not involve others or burden others with their actions. This person was not brave. They needed someone else to end their life while they killed others on their moral crusade.

What we are seeing here is someone who is obviously extremely sad, hurt, and mentally/emotionally broken. This is a mental health crisis at work here. The hurt she bares is tremendous, and is likely burried underneath a loving, caring, intelligent compassionate, goal-oriented human being, who is obviously mentally struggling. I'm telling you this as someone who has been in her shoes before. I know what that's like. I have autism, and boy have I endured my share of bullying, and hurt, and that sort of stuff. I get it. I know what its like to want to die, to lose the will to live. I never carried out acts like this, but I know EXACTLY what this woman was going through before she carried out these acts. Luckily for me, I eventually got some things I needed to become mentally stable, and that chapter of my life is over. Umfortunately, this poor woman did not get what she needed, and innocent people died.

The truth is this: She didn't want to die, she wanted the pain to stop. That's what she wanted. She felt like this was the only way to stop it, and she had probably hurt so much, I guess it was payback time.

Everytime there is a school shooting, its always: We need gun control laws, we need better police, we need to give the teachers guns to fight back, we need resource officers in schools, we need more teachers, we need better education, we need to outlaw guns all together, we need harsher sentences.

NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!! YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG!!!!!! WE DONT NEED EITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS!!!!!!!!!!!

You want all the school shootings to stop? The school shootings stop when the ROOT of the problem is treated: MENTAL HEALTH!!!!. When the subject's mental health condition is treated, then the school shootings will stop. Fix the problem at the root. The school shootings WILL NOT STOP until the mental health crisis in the struggling individual is addressed.

EVERY DAMN TIME I see a school shooting, my first thought it always: Alright, lets check the history: Autism? Bullying? Mental health somewhere, I know that. I wonder what they were struggling with mentally. I wonder what happened to their heart. I wonder what warning signs were ignored.

If you ever see a mentally struggling child, a sad, hurt, broken individual like this who has not been treated, THAT IS A SCHOOL SHOOTING WAITING TO HAPPEN. FIX THE PROBLEM!!!!!

No one kid EVER wakes up in the morning and is all like: ""Wow, what a beautiful day. What's on the agenda today? I know, lets go shoot up the school"" .... Nope.... doesn't happen. It's a very slow disease that festers over days, weeks, months, and years. It's a slow, working condition that eats the other persons brain alive to the point where the think death is the only recourse to cure the illness. Oh, and better take a few others with me as payback. 

We dont need gun laws, more police, more teachers. No no no. We need to fix the mental health problem. You will not stop it with gun laws. You will not stop it with extra resource officers. You will not stop it with more teachers.

If your culture thinks that semi regularly having dead kids is an acceptable price to pay for the coolness and freedom of mass gun ownership then that's a culture problem, but it doesn't have much to do with mental health.

Also, the US certainly has its fair share of issues but it's a little weird to say it's uniquely 'turmoil-stricken' compared to the UK.

Murderers (of any kind, no matter what tool you use) are selfish cunts!

Guns are for self defence and a quick death. Why hurt children. If I could go back in time I would put a steel fence post from her ass to 2 feet out of her mouth like vlad did and roast her over a 103F LED fire for a week or two. What a mental piece of dog shit!",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,hate

I hope her parents go to the tree they should have hung her from and apologize to it for making a kid that wasted oxygen. If there is a hell or after life I hope she's rotting, burning forever for what she did.

,dee991544,1,2023-04-17 15:25:47,What they did was wrong. I do know stuff happens as a young child such as a teacher bullies you in front of entire lunch room with 250 plus kids while the teacher is on a microphone and makes fun of you for everyone to hear. Kids get scarred for life being at a young age and kids see teachers bully so they bully and continue through out school years. Not to mention home life as they did not accept him. And has mental health issues to add to their problems. That school has some kind of meaning to him. Yes innocent people were killed but do t think he was thinking in his right mind,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,hate
