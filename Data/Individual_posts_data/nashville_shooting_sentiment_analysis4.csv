So either way in some form or fashion at some level, you are banning guns. You might not be screaming from the rooftops like Beto that you wanna take the A.R. 15 but nonetheless you’re doing the essential same thing

Yes, I agree. We need to prioritize mental health, and I think that there was a certain level of corruption in our government which prevents it from happening. I think that some gun laws, such as red flag laws are useful, but the restriction of open carry, the restriction of license to carry permits and restriction of permit less carry is counterproductive. The stigma around a person, carrying a firearm and all the things I stated contribute to the problem.

Republicans and second amendment supporters are just sick of this crap as you are. But the answer is not restricted the rights of our law-abiding citizens. The answer is to fix mental health, the answer is to reform our medical system and healthcare system. The answers to provide easy access to mental health care for both men and women, and release the stigma around getting mental health help.

,victrasuva,1,2023-03-29 13:39:09,"Here's a comment I made earlier in this thread about reducing the number of gun deaths. I've made a few edits to be more specific to our conversation.

I do think there are things that can be done to curb gun violence. Some we've already said, like finding a way for people who are going through a mental health crisis to not have access and to get the mental health support they need. That would take more than government regulation.... really lots of community effort. 

The biggest issue I have with the gun debate is we all seem to act like gun regulation would solve all gun violence. I don't think that's true. We need to break out gun violence into sections and look for specific solutions. Like urban centers, economic investment would help curb some of that violence. 

Missouri has a huge problem with veteran suicide. I'm glad our legislature has started working on ways to support our veterans to try to lower the suicide rate. Suicide attempts are more successful if there is a gun available to that person. Who is going to support banning veterans from having guns? No one or hardly anyone. The solution for these gun deaths is not regulation, but better support for our veterans at all levels. Missouri legislature is working on that and I support it. 

Domestic violence, well red flag laws banning abusers from owning firearms would help to curb those deaths. That's a gun regulation I do support. 

Now, some of the saddest gun deaths to me....the accidental deaths that happen when an adult leaves their gun out and a kid shoots it. I hate those stories because those are so preventable. That's something the gun community should keep having awareness campaigns about, gentle reminders in the community to lock up the guns. It's a small amount of gun deaths, but it just gets me every time. 

Mass shootings, I genuinely don't know what the solution is though I know it will take all of us to stop fighting about it and start having real discussions. Maybe it's required training, focusing on safety and what to do if you're having a mental health crisis, before allowing people to own certain types of guns. I don't know the answer. 

It's not just one solution, but many things that need to happen to really make a dent in the number of gun deaths every year.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,7,0,0,help

,Ozarkafterdark,1,2023-03-28 19:10:21,"No, I claim that the only way to reduce spree killings where children are targeted in gun-free zones for media attention is to restrict or ban social media. Violent crime that is based on other types of criminal intent like drug turf wars, domestic violence, and other types of violence between people who know each other is unlikely to be affected by any laws. That type of violent crime happens everywhere in the world at rates similar to the U.S. and there isn't much you can do about it other than reduce population density which isn't a very practical solution. 

This is a complicated issue and you have to be able to understand the statistical analysis and the differences between correlation and causation to really understand.  For all types of crime, you have to address the motivation for the violent act, not the implement used. The banning of guns in Australia is a good example of this.  Overall violent crime was completely unaffected by the ban, with the average yearly change remaining on the same statistical trend from 1990 (pre-ban) to the present.  You could even make the case that violent crime increased immediately after the ban although it's hard to control for other factors.

Oh, and your cracker jack responses about legislation curbing gun violence doesn't exactly stack up when gun violence is going up with the loosening of restrictions.

But there are many groups around the country, quite often religious ones, that are largely transphobic and/or anti-trans. Perhaps Hale, identifying as trans, had a shitty experience in school because of this. 

I know that in areas where islamophobia is greater, possibility of young Muslims being radicalised is higher. That idea that hurt people hurt people.

I agree that it's not justified and that is not what I meant. As an ally and a woman who is watching my rights being stripped away.... My instinct certainly is not to shoot a person.

Too bad the GOP votes against almost all economic investment at the federal level. There are lots of actions that can be taken to curb gun violence that have nothing to do with gun regulations. I agree, that all different types of gun violence will have different solutions.

There is likely a solution that will not trample second amendment rights but also pulls the veil back and allows certain individuals to be blocked from owning deadly weapons. I agree that something needs to change but I will say that options are slim considering the right to beat arms is not supposed to be infringed. In the eyes of a gun owner, myself, I think there is a mighty lot of infringing that has happened ever since the National Firearms Act and many other executive orders to include Trump and Regan. 

I also understand that people through various nefarious ways obtain Firearms illegally and use them for evil. I'm not sure how to keep those weapons out of the hands of bad people though without taking them from those like myself that can and will own them responsibly.

Almost every solution I have heard or read in the past few years would require changes that only effect people like myself all the while, criminals in general still do what they do, crime. It's hard to understand a solution that does not include collateral damage  on responsible people.

So, truly when it comes to blanket gun restrictions I struggle to be part of the conversation. I end up listening more than anything, after years of listening and learning I don't know enough about guns. 

I do think there are things that can be done to curb gun violence. Some we've already said, like finding a way for people who are going through a mental health crisis to not have access and to get the mental health support they need. That would take more than government regulation.... really lots of community effort. 

The biggest issue I have with the gun debate is we all seem to act like gun regulation would solve all gun violence. I don't think that's true. We need to break out gun violence into sections and look for specific solutions. Like how you mentioned urban centers, economic investment would help curb some of that violence. 

Missouri has a huge problem with veteran suicide. I'm glad our legislature has started working on ways to support our veterans to try to lower the suicide rate. Suicide attempts are more successful if there is a gun available to that person. Who is going to support banning veterans from having guns? No one or hardly anyone. The solution for these gun deaths is not regulation, but better support for our veterans at all levels. Missouri legislature is working on that and I support it. 

Domestic violence, well red flag laws banning abusers from owning firearms would help to curb those deaths. That's a gun regulation I do support. 

Now, some of the saddest gun deaths to me....the accidental deaths that happen when an adult leaves their gun out and a kid shoots it. I hate those stories because those are so preventable. That's something the gun community should keep having awareness campaigns about, gentle reminders in the community to lock up the guns. It's a small amount of gun deaths, but it just gets me everytime.

I just know there’s been a lot of people hurt by the church in all kinds of ways. Why not focus on the people who were affected rather than the religious establishment.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sadness
,SeemlineFF,1,2023-03-29 08:18:16,"I could argue that they just hated kids. A lot of people do act oddly around children in America. Probably because we’re a self proclaimed Christian nation and God is always just “testing them”. When really they need a mental evaluation. 

The amount of times I’ve heard a priest or pastor  say they would kill or boil a child unless they followed the Bible was enough to stay away from churches for good.",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,hate

Listen I HATE Christianity, but the shooter, he went there in his youth before he transitioned and wrote a manifesto concerning the school to be a target. Now that’s all we know as the public right now, and who knows if that’s even true, but let’s all be honest here… 

Just because we don’t like a culture or have resentment for an establishment, does not justify offensive violence and bloodshed. If he committed these murders and this rampage out of that, then let’s be *better* than the Christians by saying that , yea this is a hate crime from an unbiased perspective….we have to look out for the little god believers….for they not know what they do! 🤣😆🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈💙",1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,hate

We don’t prosecute the dead.  Also of note, is that Fox and Republicans spread a lot of trans hatered, picking on a small, vulnerable group.  Where did this line of hatred start?

He apparently missed that the shooter is dead and no longer a threat. Why this case? A woman carrying out a school shooting is incredibly rare. How about focusing on the majority of the shooters and how to prevent more shootings instead of grandstanding and fake outrage.,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,anger
