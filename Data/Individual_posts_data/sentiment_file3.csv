The shooter was definitely a student there with the rapist in the first article. Was he a victim? Maybe so. Also Being gay or trans and attending that school could have been hell. But the shooter chose now to kill….why? The GOP is taking away the rights of trans and gay people. So how does one strike back? Especially if depressed and suicidal? The politicians have too many security guards. But the kids of Republicans…they’re mostly in private Christian schools right? If you want to hurt the GOP just murder their kids. Payback for all the torture and removal of rights. Maybe the shooter thought this could make the GOP rethink what they’re doing, and back off or, if they’re still forging ahead to remove rights from people, then at least the shooter got to hurt some of them where it hurts the most before they die anyways. 

Not justifying the murders. Just wish this angle was more discussed around here bc the Christian extremists need to stop hurting the LGBTQ community.

,CraftsWithCats,2,2023-03-30 17:02:02,"Great question! Looking around online, it’s hard to find any data (and tbh, I’m not sure to what extent insurance companies are required to report on claims or to make data available, since I’m outside of that industry). Most of what I’m seeing in regards to data about sexual misconduct is EEOC reporting, in which the victims are employees, not constituents/clients/members/beneficiaries/stakeholders/etc, which is not really a useful comparison IMO (for those interested, the greatest number of EEOC sexual misconduct claims originated from the food services and accommodation industries, followed by the retail industry, with manufacturing and healthcare rounding out the top five).
 
Again, we should absolutely be concerned that churches have the level of abuse that we are seeing, but I think another important example of abuse and misconduct to look at is the Boy Scouts of America abuse settlement. The BSA’s two largest insurers were part of negotiating the settlement that was just upheld. While the BSA has strong relationships with churches (and an overall Christian alignment), they are a nonprofit organization that works with youth (according to a 2021 report by the center on nonprofits and philanthropy, 48% of nonprofits marked children and youth as one of their primary populations served). One of the things the BSA did not do well with (and similar to many churches) was having strong proactive policies in place that would restrict abuse opportunities, and enforcing those policies. Having organizational policies like always requiring at least two adults present (and especially having no one-on-one interactions), meeting in open rooms/visible spaces, etc - along with monitoring/oversight/enforcement of those policies, are good measures of how attentive an organization is protecting children/youth/vulnerable adults. 
 
An interesting side bar on abuse in religious spaces specifically: There are some denominations where the larger body has adopted specific practices that the individual congregations are expected to follow (I know the Episcopal and United Methodist denominations have existing policies). When churches are independent of a denomination (most evangelical churches), or belong to a denomination with very little governance(southern baptists), there is generally less oversight, fewer expectations, and fewer resources for creating policies for protecting vulnerable populations. One very large and glaring exception to this is of course the Catholic Church, which has tight denomination oversight and used that to NOT protect people. And the SBC used what governance they have to fail abuse victims as well.",0.0,2.0,0.0,negative

Motive:  I suspect this is in the unreleased manifesto.  It certainly would not surprise me if it is related to the shooter's experience of real or perceived abuse at the christian schools they attended.

I think removing any one of these three would have prevented or at least made it more difficult for the shooter to commit this heinous act.  I want changes to be made in each of these areas.  We, as a nation of people need to stop talking about it and DO SOMETHING.

- Stop the sale of all semi-automatic firearms.  ALL.  Yes, this includes not only AR/AK platform rifles, but also semi-auto sporting & hunting rifles, shotguns and pistols.  It's not the ""solution"" but it's a start.  And yes, I own firearms, including semi autos.  I'm willing to give them up to make our world better.

- Make it much easier to obtain mental health treatment.  It should be available to everyone at no cost.  We should also fund more education programs to remove the stigma of mental health issues.  This education should start early and in all schools.

- Religion should no longer be allowed to dictate the definition of ""normal"".  Any religion that preaches being LGBTQ+ is ""evil"" is committing a hate crime.  It is no different than if they were preaching that certain races or nationalities were ""evil"" or ""less intelligent"".  This is simply unacceptable and our society should no longer allow it.

However, we can certainly stop the retail sale of all semiautomatic firearms, both new and used.  The firearms used by this shooter were purchased legally.  If they had been forced to purchase them illegally, that is another hurdle that the shooter would have needed to get over, and another opportunity for law enforcement to become involved.

As far as the existing semiauto weapons, one possible additional step is to outlaw all transactions involving semiauto firearms.  If you own one, you keep it - but you can't sell it or give it away.  If you do, you are breaking the law and the firearm is subject to seizure.  You can possess it or you can can destroy it.   

Another possible step is to outlaw the manufacture & sale of rimless cartridges AND the components for making those cartridges (brass, bullets & dies).  This would outlaw the vast majority of ammunition that is fired in semiautos, including 9mm, 10mm, .45, 5.56/.223 (used in ARs), 7.62x39 (used in AKs).  Sure, the existing ammo *could* be reloaded with existing dies, and brass for other calibers *could* be modified to use in a semiauto - but gang-bangers aren't going to have reloading presses and dies, and it is yet another huge hurdle for a mass shooter to get over.

Earlier this month, Governor Bill Lee signed a bill that will prevent transgender youth from accessing age-appropriate, best practice medical care.

Those kids didn’t bully him. He shot children. Emphasizing his transness and how it relates to his horrific crime does nothing but hurt the trans community. He didn’t shoot kids because he’s trans, he shot kids because he is a warped person who wanted to hurt people who couldn’t do anything back because that’s how he felt. 

Trans people don’t shoot up Christian schools because of bullying, trans people kill themselves because of bullying.

,Puzzleheaded_Rain381,1,2023-04-04 00:11:03,regardless it doesn't make it right if they shot it up due to being bullied though yes they shouldn't have been bullied ( and we don't know if they were or if they came out as trans in elementary ) real Christians like myself ( though I'm catholic rather than protestant which makes up most of American Christianity ) believe everyone was made in gods image and were given free will. The villain's are the terrible evil bitch of a shooter and the people who use a religion to justify terrible acts of violence and or justify treating a group of people bad. and it Isn't just Christians that vote against much of the 1900s stuff your brining up ( I know much of it has resurfaced but no one is voting against minority voting ) what's crazy is people specifically target Christianity as if Islam or Judaism or even atheist don't do this stuff as well. Yes I get the context of the school being Christian I'm mainly addressing the lower half of the post. But we cant really blame Christian abuse for them shooting up a damn elementary school that's just ignorant especially when we have no idea and use it to justify making a post to demonize Christianity.,0.0,4.0,0.0,negative
