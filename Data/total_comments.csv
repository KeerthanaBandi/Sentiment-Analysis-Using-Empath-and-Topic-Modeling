CMV: We should stop doing widespread news coverage on mass shootings (school shootings to be specific).,TiredTransLesbian,1166,2023-04-01 19:13:32,
,3xtheredcomet,45,2023-04-01 22:38:02,"One youtuber I used to watch a lot, Philip Defranco, covers the news including mass shootings, but his policy is to never mention the killer by name nor put their picture on screen.

I feel like that's a decent compromise, what do you think?"
,Screezleby,1,2023-04-02 21:25:43,"This seems ideal. You can't censor the event successfully, but you can take away the killer's fame."
,Ok_Try_1217,46,2023-04-01 23:07:07,"One of the biggest sparks in the movement for black rights in the US was the murder of 14 year-old Emit Till. His mother insisted on a public funeral service with an open casket saying, “let the people see what they did to my boy.” Tens of thousands attended his funeral and images of his bloated, mutilated body were published in black-oriented magazines and newspapers, rallying popular black support and white sympathy across the U.S.

In the Uvalde shooting, a pediatrician who attended to the victims [described](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/09/uvalde-chief-pete-arredondo-interview/) small bodies “pulverized” and “decapitated.” Image seeing the images of the bodies of little children like that on the TV instead of just coverage of outside and people crying. Maybe that’s too extreme but, bottom line, I don’t think the way to lessen school shootings is to hide the problem. If anything, the horrendous effects need to be substantially amplified so that more action will be taken to prevent it."
,[deleted],2,2023-04-02 19:48:31,"I have to agree with this. The victims of shootings are always depicted with smiling family photos, like that charming 9 year old just went to sleep and didn't wake up. I think confronting people with the visceral reality of what a shot-up child looks like is the only way to move public opinion at this point.

ETA: Some of the most famous and powerful photos we have are of violence being done to children, to the point that they remain powerful even decades later. [Phan Thi Kim Phuc aka ""Napalm Girl""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Thi_Kim_Phuc) and [an Oklahoma City firefighter carrying the body of Baylee Almon](https://apps.bostonglobe.com/special-projects/2022/10/road-trip-america/the-photo-of-an-oklahoma-city-bombing-victim-ill-never-forget) are *still* referenced today."
,NoTeslaForMe,2,2023-04-04 00:39:39,"The fact that it worked in one case in the 68 years ago but not for decades of school shootings shows you that it ""working"" was an anomaly.  Coverage of these shootings glorifies the shooter (in spite of media trying hard to do so less than in the past) and gives the public an distorted view of what gun-related deaths and other events in the U.S. look like.  And any outrage isn't going to get the masses to change their philosophies about gun rights, just inflame already entrenched positions.  I wouldn't go as far as OP, but OP is right about the coverage being more harmful than helpful."
,Ok_Try_1217,0,2023-04-04 00:55:22,I’m sorry but which of the decades of school shootings showed the carnage of the aftermath like [this](https://imgur.com/a/rlXojgi)?
,abx99,84,2023-04-01 19:42:15,"It's important to know that things like this are happening. If they don't, then there will be nothing but resistance to anything you want to do to fix the problem. Why spend money on reforms for some issue you never even hear about? At the very least (best), it drops way down the list of priorities.

However, if they focus the coverage on the victims, and less on the perpetrator, would draw a lot more attention to the actual tragedy of the problem. These news stories affect people, and focusing less on the perpetrator and more on the victims would change how these are perceived. Right now the deaths are largely abstract to anyone not directly affected by them.

There's a lot of controversy about the photos they should show. Some think that they should show the victims, others think that's too much and would be too traumatizing. I tend to think that there's an in-between in which they could show the aftermath without showing any actual death.

This is actually an old debate. One of the most influential pictures about the Vietnam war is said to be a general executing a VC prisoner taken by Eddie Adams. Read about it here: [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42864421](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42864421)"

~~I completely agree with this.~~ I'm not sure I completely agree with this. I'm in the picture is worth a 1000 words camp. I think the brutality should be shown in full force. Parents of shooting victims that want to ban guns should be posting their kid's damaged bodies all over the media.

Emmett Til's mother knew that photos would work. She made sure her son's funeral was open casket. She wanted those photos of his mangled face to be published. She wanted people to be outraged.

Unicef knows this too. Photos of children in distress are the reason Unicef ads work as well as they do. I can't imaging Unicef would have as many donations if they used text.

Martin Luther King knew photos would work too. His protests were not just about protesting. They were about showing the brutality of jim crow laws."
,sarahelizam,4,2023-04-02 05:58:05,"Absolutely agree, especially on the part about the Civil Rights Movement. People have completely lost their understanding of what made the Civil Rights Movement effective. It wasn’t pretty words, which helped tie together the ideas of people already receptive to the message. It was the mass, visceral display of state brutality that brought the violence out of the shadows and onto the front pages and TVs of white moderates who had otherwise been able to hide from the system they were complicit in. 

Same with Rosa Parks. She wasn’t the first black woman to refuse to sit at the back of the bus - she was handpicked to be a model citizen who could inspire empathy. The news wasn’t there by happenstance. Every effective revolutionary movement of the last century knew how to utilize new media to create a narrative around their struggle. Because facts don’t change minds in areas where emotions dominate (tbh most of politics at this point). Telling a better story than the one people have been fed. That may culminate in speeches, but to get to the point they can be effective to a broader audience (not just those already in support of the cause) messaging through news media must be employed. 

We have been taught propaganda and told that groups like the Black Panthers got in the way of Civil Rights, a complete lie that ignores their role. Revolutionary movements can only make change within an existing government structure if the alternative (do nothing and deal with those with more radical positions who have little to lose) is more disruptive than making minor concessions. Because that’s what the Civil Rights Act was - a minor concession. When we talk about this movement our perceptions have been so warped by both the whitewashing and the smearing (thank you FBI and the US of A cultural hegemony in general). We have been defanged as a population, housebroken to believe that change can only come from voting, permitted protests, and civil discourse. But this is choosing the negative peace, that absence of conflict, over the positive peace of justice that MLK spoke about. Civility politics is trash when faced with a system in which incrementalism is a constant compromise to do less for the people with interests who seek to do active harm. 

We need to be reminded viscerally of the problems we face, and not just shootings. The horror of dying in a health are system that will not spare you a thought unless you pay. The reality of homelessness. Only then can we organize enough people to commit to permitted civic and direct actions that will actually address these issues. Of course the way we report on some things is important, as in the case with suicides. But we do need to address suicides and shootings and hate groups as symptoms of problems that go ignored. The mental wellness of young men especially goes overlooked by all sides and based on how we understand radicalization we can’t afford to ignore their needs. 

End rant lol"

,Trucker2827,1,2023-04-01 22:09:10,"Also not sure exactly what I think. 

On the other hand, you had thousands of families come out to see lynchings throughout the South and go entirely unpunished. It was even enjoyable to them, so there’s also a risk of normalizing really dark violence. 

I think in the past, when it was easier to ignore the world’s problems and hardly see what happens outside of your community, photos and TV were big deals in getting some of these movements going. But then, you have to consider desensitization from overexposure more recently since people are constantly seeing violent issues. And people are definitely burnt out of seeing constant mass shootings. 

Maybe it’ll even be easier for people to discuss mental health and gun control policies if we stop covering the details of the tragedies that depress people from engaging."

Such a ban also would take away the public's right to know what dangers are facing the country. Democracies can only work proprerly when the public can know what issues need to be solved. If the public doesn't know that school shootings are a problem they won't vote for the anti-gun candidate. 

If we ban the news about mass shootings it allows a great argument that we should ban news reporting on other subjects in the name of prevention or public safety. We could ban news about police shootings because it leads to riots. We could ban news about train accidents to prevent panic. . . ."

,xtaberry,96,2023-04-02 00:54:42,"But in the USA, you have guidance against covering certain activities in detail because coverage inspires copy-cats. Suicides, for instance: although they can be covered, there is supposed to be no discussion of methods, there is guidance about avoiding sensationalist headlines or speaking about a suicide ""epidemic"" or ""crisis"", and there is advice against interviewing first responders or family members. Reporters are told to speak about the victims life, not dwell on the act of suicide, and provide resources as a part of the news segment.

This isn't law - mostly, it comes from organizations like the Foundation for Suicide Prevention who makes suggestions and news outlets who implement them voluntarily. I don't understand why the USA doesn't have something similar for school shootings. There needs to be less dramatization, and less child victims being put in front of the world to discuss their unprocessed trauma. The life of the victims should be honored first and foremost, and the identity of the shooter or how they did it or with which gun should not be the topic of public discourse."
,willthesane,14,2023-04-02 01:37:53,"We all agree you are right, the problem is violence like this sells news paper, people cla.or for news. Aside from a law suppressing it, I don't think anything could be done.

,AndySocks,9,2023-04-02 06:52:48,"No you’re right, since it seems inevitable for the media to not cover a school/mass shooting, we need to at least change the way we cover shootings on the news.

Take what was reported once the media outlets got hold of the security footage from the Nashville event. They showed the shooter walking through the school hallways with gun in hand. Imagine some troubled kid at home watching that, with envy in his eyes and an AR half locked in his dad’s basement.

Until we can figure out a way to prevent access to these weapons of war, we can at least try to not put these shooters in the spotlight. This will be difficult but it’s like they say: “If it bleeds, it leads.”"

,Barrayaran,1,2023-04-02 16:51:50,"I think the news still does cover serial killings. They cover (most) murders and (some) disappearances by default; when it becomes clear that murders are linked, that actually increases the coverage. Serial killers sell.

a few years ago in Boston there were and there were a spate of young, gay men ending up in the harbor and the news never said what it was or how they died. I think it was informativity without sensationalism. don't know if it was a killer or not but it was something weird going on.

>But one difficulty implementing such inform rules is that a large fraction of the population believe that mass shootings are due to mental instability of the shooter, and have nothing to do with acess to firearms.

I disagree. People **say** that's what they believe. But anyone who believes toddlers and terrorists shouldn't be allowed to have guns is acknowledging that (1) guns are designed to be the most efficient way to hurt or kill people, and (2) gun control -- keeping guns away from people who pose a danger, intentionally or not, to themselves or others -- is therefore necessary.

It's highly unlikely that this would actually happen, but if news outlets are willing to put people's lives into consideration rather than clicks, I think the right approach for them would be to stop covering these stories. Like I said in my post, while it's highly unlikely, we're at a point where I honestly think it's more likely that every news outlet comes together to decide to stop publishing stories about mass shootings than it is for the government to put a ban on firearms."
,slybird,35,2023-04-01 19:46:15,Then one of my points would still stand. Domocracies work best when the voters are informed about what is going on.

2020 only saw 20 deaths, probably thanks to COVID. But 2018 saw 61 deaths.

So in recent years, ignoring covid, over 50 children per year get killed and many more get injured or traumatized as a result of gunfire incidents in the United States.

Could you consider conceding that other solutions exist that don't require further restrictions in US law, and have been demonstrated to work? Everyone agrees the continually repeating tragedies need to end, and I think most would agree that it should happen as fast as possible. Ridding a country of 350+ million people with more firearms than people seems unrealistic, especially when considering the willingness of states to help in that goal.

I assume for this next part you hold a perspective open to policies like welfare. Countries have demonstrated that they can have proportionally high gun ownership with disproportionally low rates of gun homicide when compared the US. Switzerland, Czechia, and Finland are some of a few countries that have these high rates of ownership with low violence, with similar restrictions (if not less in some cases) as states in the US. Social welfare across the board lowers crime. Crime (That isn't the actual homicide itself, i.e. robbery) is the cause of a majority of gun homicides. Access to social welfare differentiates these countries from the US which allows them to trust its citizenry to be armed (Or in the case of Switzerland, tell its citizenry to be armed). These countries also have judiciaries much more lenient and rehabilitation focused, and more ""gun culture"" that revolves around education (like middle school rifle clubs),.

And in the meantime, children get slaughtered. While people stand around discussing welfare, the welfare of children in schools gets forgotten.

It's very difficult to compare the mindset of other countries. Better to compare like with like.

The states in America that have the strictest gun laws have the lowest murders via guns, correct?

People do not need rapid-fire guns. That is what shooters are mostly bringing into schools, correct?

Kids deserve our protection, correct? We're failing them and allowing their slaughter, correct?

The stats in the US are absolute shit. Fix the gun ownership laws first and then compare with other countries.

Any rebuttal to the premise that countries with similar gun laws to the US are able to have less homicide? That is the core of my suggestion. You cannot say to change ""X"" before we can do a comparison if ""X"" is an independent variable that stays the same for the comparison. You are using a circular argument here, the point *is* that the US laws aren't incongruent with low gun homicide.

Also your source doesn't rebut that [high gun ownership countries](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/178/proportion_of_households_with_firearms/194,49,65,136) can have [low gun homicide](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/178/rate_of_gun_homicide/49,194,136,65).

,Im_Daydrunk,2,2023-04-02 09:39:10,"IMO Switzerland has a lot that seperates it even from a civilian happiness standpoint and shouldn't be used as an example to support the US not needing to deal with their gun issues

The Swiss for example have much stricter gun laws (including it not being allowed to just carry the guns wherever you go), guns aren't worshiped like they are in the USA, and most of those guns are former service weapons and the people who have them went through extensive training with them. Also the Swiss don't fight in wars or have widespread desire for killing/using weapons to attack other countries. They tend to see guns as purely a tool to defend themselves in the absolute worst case scenario and take pride in competitions that turn guns more into sporting equipment 

The USA, seperate from their poor social welfare/mental health care, has a dangerously obsessive relationship with guns to the point where many people who want to have guns actively fantasize about using guns to kill people in ""justifed"" ways. I feel that even if you were to magically fix a lot of the underlying social issues the US would still have lots of gun deaths because many people bring them into situations that no country (even one with a lot of guns like the Swiss) would support. They are treated as a vital part of being an American and not as a tool that should only be used if absolute required

So I do think the accessibility of guns for untrained people and how they are viewed in the US absolutely play a major part to the violence we have. Its not just poor people failed by the system or inadequate mental health treatments IMO"

That's the point, that a society that embraces social welfare, prison rehabilitation, etc. can have low homicide (overall). Comparing US states misses any significant differences in social welfare and prisoner rehabilitation. While states with stricter gun law may have slightly less gun homicide, it is not [as pronounced as the difference between societies with different support systems.](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/178/rate_of_gun_homicide/49,136,194,288,331,320,304) (over 18x less gun homicides in Switzerland than New York, and Switzerland has less restrictive gun laws than New York. Compare this to the 2.6x decrease from Texas to New York, Texas being a state with slightly less restrictive gun laws than Switzerland)

>I mean, if you want to compare other countries, then you could compare countries whose citizens have few guns, like Australia, and see how many school shootings or mass shootings they have. There is your independent variable

The independent variable is gun ownership laws. Other countries have similar laws. The dependent variable is gun homicide. It is lower in those other countries.

No, the experiment can only be held in the USA. Like with like. And it is being held. There is more than enough data. Compare Hawaii with the Southern states, for starters.

>Comparing to Australia misses the point entirely, except for it being another society with better social welfare that results in lower overall crime.

I'm afraid you don't know the history. The gun laws came into effect due to a mass shooting in 1996. After the guns were taken away en masse-- no more mass shootings. It's now a safe country where there has never been a school shooting and no one would have cause to worry about a mass shooting in the streets.

No change in social welfare, prisoner rehab etc etc. Just quick, bold, brave gun laws.

>over 18x less gun homicides in Switzerland than New York, and Switzerland has less restrictive gun laws than New York.

Again, you cannot compare these two places. New York suffers from the terrible gun laws in other states. They can't stop guns from being bought in from weak states that have weak gun laws.

Hawaii benefits from being a state that isn't as easy to bring in guns from across borders, as it's an island state. It also benefits from its much stronger gun laws."

What? Why would I compare those things if they aren't relevant to my thesis? You are misunderstanding my thesis so read the next part with an open mind to reconsider your perspective:  


I am not saying gun laws are ineffective. I am stating alternative solutions exist and are shown to work.   


The European countries are being used as examples of places with similar gun laws and ownership rates, but exponentially less gun homicide and crime. **Do you know why this is?**

Not gonna happen fortunately.  Gun ownership has skyrocketed, and facts and information to counter the Reefer Madness type of anti 2a propaganda is too easily available.

The meth head most probably wants to steal, not harm the lady. By the time she finds her gun and gets it ready to shoot, the risk to her is greater than if she didn't confront the intruder. And if she shoots and misses, then the meth addict might choose to kill her.

What are ""rights""? Some words on a piece of paper written back when guns were nothing like they are today?

>No, because that’s illegal and is not a valid tool for self defense.

Why is it illegal? What if I want to walk about with my DBU bomb & intimidate people? What if I want to stash bombs at my house in case of intruders? What about my bomb rights?

Such as?

Or we could just protect the most important thing on the planet (aka kids) with armed security the same way we do useless old fuck politicians and businessmen.

Not just old ladies to be clear, women of all ages who are at a huge physical disadvantage to their attackers, and it happens way more often than you’d realize.  Most people aren’t aware of the number of DGU’s, because the fascist elites who are trying to disarm us, don’t like those instances being highlighted.

>	And yeah, being robbed is nothing like being attacked. It isn’t.

That’s a strawman.  I was just pointing out how insane it is to pretend that it’s ok that they just cower in fear and pray that luck is on their side, while someone rifles through their valuable (often irreplaceable) possessions.

>	Those are the tired phrases of people who don’t really care about what happens to other people,

No, anti gunners just get upset when someone points out their fascism isn’t actually a solution.  Or if anyone uses facts and statistics to form their opinion instead of the fear, disinformation, and attempts to prey on emotions that are relied upon by the elites and their puppets.

>	What are “rights”? Some words on a piece of paper written back when guns were nothing like they are today?

Yikes.  First off, that’s as silly as pretending you shouldn’t be able to say what you want on your phone because they never could have envisioned that technology…  Secondly, you are wrong, there were firearms at the time that utilized multiple barrels to fire multiple projectiles, auto loading, literal cannons, etc.  And lastly but most importantly, you realize the constitution doesn’t *give* us our rights, right?  It just recognizes they exist, whether the constitution does or not.  They’re inalienable.

>	Why is it illegal?

Because it is not a tool that can be used for self defense, and is only used to cause destruction.  Speaking of tho, you really think that if you somehow magically banned guns, these sick fucks would just stop attacking people.  Or would they just use other inanimate objects like in the bath school massacre or all the truck attacks in other instances (that caused way more death and destruction)?

Oh, I do know. It's usually a male who is known to them who attacks them - those are the clear stats. As happened to me at the hands of a husband. I've also had my house robbed about 3 times. Yes, it's painful, but it's nothing compared with being attacked physically. And when women are shot, it's usually a male who is known to them -- a boyfriend, husband or ex. You cannot be armed at all times against someone you live with, but they are the people most dangerous to you.

>Or if anyone uses facts and statistics to form their opinion instead of the fear,

Fear is an interesting thing. It's easy not to be concerned when you are among the groups least likely to be the victim of the thing being spoken about.

>They’re inalienable

So you think.

>Speaking of tho, you really think that if you somehow magically banned guns, these sick fucks would just stop attacking people.

Obviously the answer to that is ""no"". I have already said a couple of times that we need to keep schools secure and not allow people in unchecked.

>Because it is not a tool that can be used for self defense

I'm pretty certain no one will come near me if I have a hand grenade. That's self defence. I'm also pretty sure people shouldn't be walking around with objects that can kill and maim many others within a space of seconds.

Sorry to hear that.  I wish you and my mom, and my sister, and every woman who has ever been beat, had a gun on them.

My personal experiences are different.  But tbf I was a kid at that time and had gotten pretty used to getting beat.

But the point is tho, none of that should happen.  And if it does, the criminal should be taught a lesson.

>	And when women are shot, it’s usually a male who is known to them – a boyfriend, husband or ex.

That’s why we should fight the propaganda and the obstacles that contribute to a culture of unarmed women.

Not with that attitude (I’m joking… mostly).  But that’s why you arm yourself to get out of that situation, not stay in it.

>	It’s easy not to be concerned when you are among the groups least likely to be the victim of the thing being spoken about.

You have no clue what you’re talking about.  I would bet everything I have that I’ve lost more loved ones to gun violence than you.

Not when taking innocent people out with you could’ve been prevented.

You realize trucks (like the one used in Nice, France) are responsible for some of the worst mass killings we’ve seen, right?  Should those be banned too?

>	While children get slaughtered, people argue about “mah alienable rights!”

Agreed, it’s pathetic that we have to go on the defensive because the fascist elites (not calling you that to be clear, I think you believe you’re actually doing the right thing) use these tragedies to attack the law abiding and strip rights, instead of us all figuring out actual solutions (like the one you mentioned about preventing unauthorized access)."

,Plazmatic,8,2023-04-02 00:17:34,"First, I support assault weapons bans or things like it.  But this is something at least some gun advocates are not entirely wrong about. Assault weapon is a legal term, and legally differs from state to state.  The ability for a state to define an assault weapon is part of what was included in the initial assault weapon ban.  And contrary to what people say, only *federal* bans on assault weapons were lifted, which used [it's own definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon#:~:text=Drawing%20from%20federal%20and%20state,one%20or%20more%20other%20features.):

> ""In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use.""

Which *was*  less arbitrary than what many states consider assault weapons, despite the still vague wording (IMO, it's probably closer to what you and I think an assault weapon actually is). 

But other states, like California, have a different list of features: https://giffords.org/lawcenter/state-laws/assault-weapons-in-california/

> * A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and at least one of the following additional features:
(1) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;
(2) a thumbhole stock;
(3) a folding or telescoping stock;
(4) a grenade or flare launcher;
(5) a flash suppressor; or
(6) a forward pistol grip;17

> * A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than ten rounds;

> * A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that has an overall length of less than 30 inches;

> * A semiautomatic pistol that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and any one of the following: 1) a threaded barrel, capable of accepting a flash suppressor, forward handgrip, or silencer; 2) a second handgrip; 3) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the barrel allowing the bearer to fire the weapon without burning his or her hand, except a slide that encloses the barrel; or 4) the capacity to accept a detachable magazine at some location outside of the pistol grip;

> * A semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than ten rounds;

> * A semiautomatic shotgun that has both a folding or telescoping stock, and a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon, thumbhole stock, or vertical handgrip;

> * A semiautomatic shotgun that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine;

> * A shotgun with a revolving cylinder; or

> * A semiautomatic centerfire firearm that is not technically a rifle, pistol, or shotgun, if it either has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds, has an overall length of less than 30 inches, or does not have a fixed magazine but has at least one of the features associated with assault weapons, as described above.18

Notice how there's a lot more specificity here. But also there's rules like ""A semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than ten rounds"".   Some of the most popular *pistols* in the world right now accept *multiple* magazines that far exceed 10 rounds. https://blog.refactortactical.com/blog/10-most-popular-handguns/.  This effectively bans many *normal pistols*.   My understanding is there's other oddities about these rules that make things difficult as well for certain non problematic situations, but someone else will have to expand on those.  This is what gun owners start to get mad about, some of the rules end up seeming arbitrary. 

News media also constantly calls otherwise nominal pistols or other non ""assaulty"" weapons by definition, ""assault weapons"", or similarly scary terms.   Gun subreddits are full of examples of media making otherwise normal function, a common one is ""semi-automatic"".  Virtually all modern pistols are ""semi-automatic"", semi-automatic corresponds to the fact that you don't have to manually load bullets into the gun, you squeeze the trigger and the next bullet gets loaded in automatically then you squeeze again, and it fires, and the next bullet comes in, not ""burst fire/ fully automatic fire"".  Yet the word is wielded in a way to make you think ""Something that doesn't shoot quite as long as a fully automatic assault rifle"". 

Now some gun nuts will claim there's a ""media bias against guns"" when the *actual* bias is that media will try to get the most views/clicks, which sensationalism does, and not some illuminati anti second amendment cult like they act.  Media is ambivalent to guns themselves."

I don't agree on your overall opinion on gun control, but I agree with this statement. In my opinion this resentment towards the media stems from (as you said) their inherent business model *and also* lack of education/understanding on the complicated topic that is firearms.

Firearms have existed for 735 years, and the US Federal government has had laws on them for 89 years. These law's foundation was the tax code and enforced by the Department of Treasury.

I 100% agree with doing this first. As I've already said in this discussion. Secure the schools. Not one child should die at the hands of a killer coming into a school, no matter what the killer's plan of attack is.

>It will not be possible to remove millions of guns from the streets.

No. But the gun restrictions put in place in states such as Hawaii show what's possible and how everyone can be safer.

>This Supreme Court will strike down any assault weapons ban.

They've been banned before and can be banned again. And the supreme court can come to their senses. Just because they're not small children who don't have a voice and just because they are among a group least likely to ever die via a gun attack, doesn't mean they can't wake up.

>These shootings are increasing because of contagion and how easy they are to perpetrate.

Contagion doesn't explain why they're almost all young white males who are the school shooters. It has to be a number of factors, including how guns are marketed to young men."

There has been a lot of actual research done on this subject, called mass shooting contagion theory. 149 researchers and law enforcement actually [wrote an open letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4Z7VkWcwLk-SjFJc00tdmI1eW8/view?resourcekey=0-hj8_5Jdjyej8UI_7lvrSKw) encouraging the media to stop making shooters famous. 

Fame-seeking is now a common motive among mass shooters, having grown appreciably since about 2000. Fame seekers tend to be younger and to have about double the average victim count. Fame-seeking mass shooters also tend to get more media coverage, thus fulfilling their goal.

That is, violent media in children has been shown to lead to violence in those same kids as they grow into teenagers, but that hasn’t been shown in adults.

NPR: ""This spring the U.S. Education Department reported that in the 2015-2016 school year, ""nearly 240 schools ... reported at least 1 incident involving a school-related shooting.""

ACLU: ""Over 230 schools reported school shootings. However, two school districts mistakenly reported each of their schools as having a shooting. The data from these two districts accounted for 63 of the reported shootings.  

Everytown Research, a nonprofit organization, reports that less than 30 school shootings occurred in K-12 settings during the 2015-16 school year, a far cry from the nearly 240 reported by the Trump administration.

,The_White_Ram,9,2023-04-01 21:36:04,"Exactly. It's also the case with mass shootings and how those are reported.

The problem with having a discussion about mass shootings in the United States is that no one is really on the same page as to what the definition is. My perception is that the term ""mass shooting"" is commonly and colloquially associated with a lone wolf individual who goes on a shooting spree spontaneously/randomly that wasn't the result of a different criminal act.

Unfortunately there is no fixed definition of a mass shooting in the United States, and different researchers define ""mass shootings"" in different ways. 

For example gunviolence.org which is commonly cited, defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot. In 2019 they reported 417 mass shootings. 

Compare this with the FBI who defined ""Active Shooter Incidents"" similar to how it is colloquially used (lone wolf, spontaneous/random, not a motive associated with a different criminal act), who identifed 28 Active shooter incidents. 
https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-in-the-us-2019-042820.pdf/view

Its important to note that the FBI's definition excluded similar events that were motivated by gang-violence, self defense, drug violence, crossfire as a byproduct of another ongoing criminal act, (several other items).

To me it seems like the large majority of the ""mass shootings"" in the US are the result of pre-existing criminal activity and not the lone wolf type person that people commonly associate with the term ""mass shooting""."

The new definition exists for a reason. It used to not be so complicated. But about ten years ago, the mods of the most rabidly anti-gun sub on Reddit came up with a new expanded definition to pump the numbers up by including common criminal incidents (especially gang on gang). They made a web site about it, that got some media traction, and that web site was later integrated into gunviolence.org. Then the media really latched on to this new scarier definition, and confusion followed.

Obviously they want the attention though. I’m just not sure if people realize that everyone has a platform these days. I hear more and more about crimes being committed on live streaming platforms, photos and videos posted on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, twitter, etc.. and then afterwards everyone flocks to these platforms to find more information. Recently a group of girls around 13 tortured another girl for hours and posted the videos online. The media can’t disclose their identities because they’re minors, but they identified themselves on the places people actually hear about these things on- social media.

,sapphon,2,2023-04-02 04:02:39,"Your idea is a very old one, at least as old as Egypt's 18th Dynasty and Hapshepsut.  The name people use for your idea in my culture is from more than a thousand years later, because we have a hard-on for the Romans I guess: 'damnatio memoriae', as practiced against Nero and many others.

The idea is, if a person commits crimes against the state, one of the things the state should be able to do, it was reasoned, was deny them their popular fame going forward.  This was attempted to such extent that I think would make even you possibly blanch - historical records were altered, birth and death records destroyed, official documents edited, *artworks defaced*, and *structures destroyed*.  Conspicuously referring to the punished by name in public could see *the speaker punished too*.  The idea was to render it as if this MF *never existed*!  

Chyeah, defy the laws for the sake of your personal fame now, I dare ya.  Right?  It'd be self-defeating.  Except.

The insurmountable problems with our attempting to impose such a punishment ourselves would be at least two.  I've already cheekily revealed one in the scope of this comment, and the other can be developed out of only a grade-school understanding of US civics - the US being where most of these highly publicized mass shootings take place.  Can you guess what the problems are?

* First, *I have provided you examples of individuals so damned*.  Think about that.  If we now know when Nero lived, what Nero did, and that he suffered this punishment and when and why and at whose hands - well, it **cannot have worked**.  It didn't work.  It doesn't work, for the same reason that a police officer cannot just nicely ask passing motorists not to look at an an accident - human curiosity is somewhat morbid.

* Second, US citizens live under capitalism and are very protective of their ""free speech"" - a term that is *not* well understood by them, leading to pejoratives like 'muh freeze peach', but in this case it's an open-and-shut case: the government cannot tell you not to talk about something because it thinks a shooter's memory needs damning.  It legally just can't.  Businesses can deplatform you and private invididuals can try to silence you using their private resources - which is such an enormous power that it might actually be enough, *if* every business colluded with one mind.  That's why I mentioned capital - there's almost always a profit motive for *someone* to provide a minority report, even if most outlets might agree on what's polite to print; we're the country that gave birth to stormfront.org, FFS.

So, liberal democracies don't really have the tools to ""unfamous"" someone to the same extent that historical authorities who tried to do so had; meanwhile, *even those historical attempts failed*, so I'd like to change your view in that the ship for this kind of ham-handed control of information has demonstrably sailed for the moment!

The news salivates when shit like this happens. The more dramatic the better. Controversial? Even better. I have a coworker that absolutely THRIVES on drama and goes running to tattle to the boss on whatever employee made an error. She crows to me, and gets all “upset” but really is enjoying the dramatic results. She will call a customer who is upset and put them on speaker phone so everyone can hear how awful they can be, yet her responses and treatment on,y escalates the issue. What starts as a mild irritation easily fixed by placating and assurances unfolds into this big ordeal where they want her boss’s contact information and now they will send Ring footage, and lawyers are brought up, veiled threats if it happens again…all avoidable with an apology or at minimum an empathetic ear but strong one line response repeated a few times. Many times I’ve calmed an irate customer with a no, but said after I listened, empathized and gently said nope over and over- 

I understand how you feel but unfortunately this is the resolution. 

I get it and wish I had another answer but unfortunately this is the resolution. 

Yes, I’d be upset as well, but unfortunately this is the resolution. 

Newscasters go for the mist inflammatory story, and repeat it ad nauseam. It takes the focus off the real issue; the mental,health crisis we face because no one wants to FIX mental health issue, they want to toss some pills out, or worse, arrest people with mental illness because finding care is impossible. No one wants to do that very difficult job for minimum wage, and that’s all that is offered. The CEO gets the fat check, the workers get hit and spit on and have to get food stamps to survive. No one wants that so they go flip burgers instead for the same wage, without the spit and bruises. 

We have a mental illness crisis. Mentally ill people can’t hold a job, many end up homeless and turn to street drugs to cope. Some lash out out of self defense. Some were abused growing up, either by family or church, or bullies in school, or a sports leader/coach or what have you. 

I can easily list off more than 20 people I know that grew up with some sort of trauma from childhood…and some didn’t cope well after. Public school, private school, sports teams at school or private teams, parents together, divorced, one parent absent, agnostic, atheist, devout, it didn’t matter. Some can process and grow from it, and some are stunted or damaged from it. 

We need to pay attention to the ones that “disappear” into the crowd. We need to hear the silent cry for help. We need to notice, and care more for those who suffer, rather than treat them like trash. 

Guns are just a tool. They are not the problem, mental illness is primary.

First off, while it's true that some perpetrators of mass shootings seek infamy, news coverage is essential for the public to understand the gravity of the situation and the need for urgent policy changes. Without widespread coverage, the general public may not realize the extent of the problem, and there would be less pressure on lawmakers to implement gun control measures or other policies to prevent future tragedies.  


Widespread news coverage can contribute to public pressure on lawmakers to implement stricter gun control measures. Without this coverage, there may be less urgency and motivation for legislators to take action. By keeping the issue in the public eye, the media can help maintain the momentum needed for policy changes that could potentially save lives.

Even WITH the coverage we have, this issue has been and continues to get swept under the rug in this country. After Sandy Hook, Uvalde and countless others we are STILL desensitized to children being slaughtered in a place where they should be safe. If we could see what the responders saw the horrifying reality of this would call more people to action than less.  


Secondly, the media has a responsibility to report on significant events, including mass shootings. What you are proposing is impossible in the first place because you can not restrict the press in the USA. However, news organizations should adopt responsible reporting practices that minimize the risk of inspiring copycats. For instance, they can avoid sharing the shooter's name or face, avoid sensationalism, and focus on facts and prevention measures rather than speculation."
,GenderDimorphism,3,2023-04-01 19:47:14,The downside to that is then I can't use school shootings to push for political agendas that I had before the shooting even happened. Everything is fair game when it comes to politics.

,AggravatingTartlet,0,2023-04-01 23:17:07,"I don't think not reporting it would work.

Because I'm unsure if it's fame most school shooters want. I think they carry out shootings to cause maximum, lasting pain to a whole community, because they feel pain and want others to feel it, too. They often want to die, and know their death at the hands of police will cause their families pain, too -- so that forms part of it. They'll never get to enjoy any ""fame"" because they won't be alive to see it.

Some groups in society tend to inflict pain on others when they feel pain - and boys & men do this far more than girls and women. Girls and women tend to take pain in and keep it inside and hurt themselves. (In general - I do not mean to talk about all boys/men and all girls/women here)

School shootings have very, lasting widespread effects. It's not only about the victims who were shot. Schools are close communities. So every child in a school that had a shooter -- especially the kids who witnessed it -- will carry lifelong effects. That goes for the teachers and everyone else who works or volunteers at schools, too.  
  
And then there's the siblings and families of the child victims and their whole communities and towns. They all bear the mark and trauma of each school shooting.

The United States has 120.5, almost 4 times as many as Switzerland and 10 times as Czech. The reason Finland and Switzerland are even that high is because of mandatory military service for male citizens. The government is literally encouraging them to own and maintain a firearm.

>I have been to three of those four countries and I can tell you they are all very far away from having gun ownership normalized the way it is in the US

I beg to differ, at least from my anecdotal experience having Swiss relatives. Swiss  (and German) people are more private, they would not announce it. [Switzerland still has child/teen gun clubs that are state-sponsored and their shooting sports federation is their 4th largest.](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/gun-fun_switzerland--where-five-year-olds-learn-to-shoot/44018466) Sport shooting in the US is nowhere near as popular in the US as it is in Switzerland. That is about as normalized as normal can get IMO.

If you are commenting on the overall US gun culture I do concur that is wildly different, and I only theorize that it is due to the political polarization of firearms. (As a result of the US system of lobbying and the NRA) However, no empirical data I've seen has drawn a link between the US gun culture and things like gun homicide or death.

>Not only that, guns owned by citizens in the United States have on average more fire power than in those other countries

Also, anecdotally I beg to differ (Switzerland literally gave half of its population military rifles for decades if not centuries lol) and some further elaboration would be appreciated. The same weapons in the US can be attained in Switzerland, with even less restrictions on things like: short barreled rifles, short barreled shotguns, suppressors, machine guns, foreign/imported weapons, ""normal"" semi automatic rifles that were converted from machine guns, and more."

But most everyone agrees that the only way we are going to democratically make change in this country is for everyone to be informed about what is happening.

Gun control originated as a form to suppress tired minority voices, like yours as a trans lesbian (im also trans and queer). The Black Panther Party was a really historically important civil rights (and importantly, leftist) group. The NRA helped pass the Mulford Act, in response to the Panthers movement. The NRA back then was completely fine with taking away guns as long as it was from minorities. Sound familiar? Look at the state of right wing media right now. Fellow queer person, I shouldn’t have to spell this out to you: the politicians who consider passing gun control don’t care to stop school shootings. That would require a comprehensive expansion of  mental healthcare, something they and their lobbyists have zero intention to pass. 

Gun control in American history is a mechanism to prevent minorities from self defense. The south is likely trying to get transgender defined as a mental illness again, to stop the arming of trans people."

Have you given any serious thought to the logistics of doing this? Pretend for a second that the second amendment was repealed or interpreted such that there is no longer an individual right to own guns. 40% of American households and 30% of adult individuals own guns. There are literally more guns than people in the United States, over 300 million of them. The vast majority of gun owners are not going to give them up voluntarily. In fact, you will create a MASSIVE black market for guns. Prohibition has not really ever worked well.

For those that will not voluntarily give up their guns, are you going to have swat teams breaking down their doors to take them? You would need more swat teams that are currently in existence and they would have to be incredibly well armed and trained. Many people would die. 

The existence of guns in the US is a foregone conclusion for anyone who acknowledges reality. We are just going to have to figure out how to manage it."

It's an incredibly delusional/distorted worldview to have, but if you're shooting up a school and planning to die as well you're clearly not thinking right. Children are innocent, you're right.

I think its because you guys are so insecure, you dont want to be the guy to be made fun of, so you guys are quick to try and put it on others instead, so that now like 5 years later all these subs and discords have been taken over by the same toxic people who are on all the time, and have their little insecure beta boys copying them. All the casuals have been pushed out, like Ive seen some subs and discords with a fraction of the users that used to be there.

I walked into his room one day and he just had this blank look on his face that I’ve never seen before, and for some reason I just said, “You need help, don’t you?”- and he nodded, so we went to the hospital. 

After dropping him off I was taking a shower back home, and two cop cars came into the driveway, so I answered the door in my towel lol. Apparently he told someone at school he was going to end it, so the cops came to “arrest him”."

We actually joke about it now, not in a mean way, but he now realizes how stupid that would have been, so we play around with it. I’ll spare you the details though.

All they knew was that something bad was going to happen and that the person was suicidal. I'd guess that on a list of crimes or events that you'd need to have police look into, suicide is probably lower in priority than things like armed robbery, murder, gang violence etc. Suicide really sucks for the people around the victim, but ultimately as far as law enforcement is concerned the crime and the victim are the same and it wraps itself up in a neat bow. 

I'm not in law enforcement, I'm just guessing here. I just don't think we can hold the cops to such a high standard that they needed to be able to mind read the situation to understand it was more than they were told."

The friend called the non-emergency at 10:14 am. Police came to her house at 3 pm. 

Imagine the devastation knowing that something could’ve been done to prevent this.

EDIT:
However, if the friend would’ve communicated that the person said “you’ll see it in the news” maybe the response would’ve been different. That’s very typical for people who are trying to commit suicide by cop.

,knicksyankeesGoT,1,2023-03-28 13:42:37,"Most people do not struggle with suicide so when I say normal, I mean that the majority of people do not experience life in the same way as those who struggle with said ideation.

Our brains normally have a mechanism hardwired for self-preservation. A breakdown in how one responds to adversity/pain or if it doesn't have a general response can be a major factor for those who struggle with suicide. I'm not a neurologist, so I don't know what causes it, but we're speaking generally. 

My speculation, since everything is epigenetic, is that the environment we've cultivated and currently live in has changed too fast for our brains to adapt. Such rapid changes around us can create new issues as well as compound existing ones. Sure, there are plenty of amenities and things fixed that have tremendous benefits and upside. What comes up is that there are perhaps non-obvious issues that were both unknown and unpredictable that we now face regardless of how we got here. Summing it up, there's always been factors that triggered someone to be more susceptible to suicide, but our ultra connected lives now could be triggering a higher % of people now than in the past for external reasons.

If we take what I'm saying above as plausible, it could lead to not only suicidal ideation but a whole mess of normative ethics being ""dismissed"" that normal heads take for granted. The event highlights some of this, suicidal ideation perhaps lead them to view themselves as already dead, and thus only an actor for a moral cause/crusade. 

""I'm already ""dead,"" but there's still things that mattered to me when I was ""alive."" My body can be a vessel for change since I'm already gone.""

Now, this is a crude and generic way to frame what I'm getting at. One shouldn't be so quick to throw their life away for causes, but we can imagine there would be people (loved ones/parents/children) or things (sovereignty/private property/personal freedoms) that one might consider giving their life to protect. However, if there's an inability/dysfunction to distinguish what hits that bar (normatively), there can be a lot of really bad consequences of the charged political environment we're currently in.

When liberals try to make it seem that genocide is occurring when it isn't, or when conservatives try to make it seem like there's an invasion happening when there isn't, there's going to be people, admittedly small %, whom view this as a call to action. They can already view themselves as ""dead"" and only as a tool to further a moral crusade they feel is just.

All of this to say, those who commit suicide can be brave, assuming they do not involve others or burden others with their actions. This person was not brave. They needed someone else to end their life while they killed others on their moral crusade. 

Fuck Tucker Carlson, Fuck Voosh, and all the other begging the question idiots for using their lack of culpability to obfuscate the real harms their narratives create."

I know what its like to want to die, to lose the will to live. I never carried out acts like this, but I know EXACTLY what this woman was going through before she carried out these acts. Luckily for me, I eventually got some things I needed to become mentally stable, and that chapter of my life is over. Umfortunately, this poor woman did not get what she needed, and innocent people died.

The truth is this: She didn't want to die, she wanted the pain to stop. That's what she wanted. She felt like this was the only way to stop it, and she had probably hurt so much, I guess it was payback time.

Everytime there is a school shooting, its always: We need gun control laws, we need better police, we need to give the teachers guns to fight back, we need resource officers in schools, we need more teachers, we need better education, we need to outlaw guns all together, we need harsher sentences.

NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!! YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG!!!!!! WE DONT NEED EITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS!!!!!!!!!!!

You want all the school shootings to stop? The school shootings stop when the ROOT of the problem is treated: MENTAL HEALTH!!!!. When the subject's mental health condition is treated, then the school shootings will stop. Fix the problem at the root. The school shootings WILL NOT STOP until the mental health crisis in the struggling individual is addressed.

EVERY DAMN TIME I see a school shooting, my first thought it always: Alright, lets check the history: Autism? Bullying? Mental health somewhere, I know that. I wonder what they were struggling with mentally. I wonder what happened to their heart. I wonder what warning signs were ignored.

If you ever see a mentally struggling child, a sad, hurt, broken individual like this who has not been treated, THAT IS A SCHOOL SHOOTING WAITING TO HAPPEN. FIX THE PROBLEM!!!!!

No one kid EVER wakes up in the morning and is all like: ""Wow, what a beautiful day. What's on the agenda today? I know, lets go shoot up the school"" .... Nope.... doesn't happen. It's a very slow disease that festers over days, weeks, months, and years. It's a slow, working condition that eats the other persons brain alive to the point where the think death is the only recourse to cure the illness. Oh, and better take a few others with me as payback. 

We dont need gun laws, more police, more teachers. No no no. We need to fix the mental health problem. You will not stop it with gun laws. You will not stop it with extra resource officers. You will not stop it with more teachers.

There is only one way to fix this problem: And that is on the mental health level. As soon as the mental health problem is fixed, the school shootings will stop."

If your culture thinks that semi regularly having dead kids is an acceptable price to pay for the coolness and freedom of mass gun ownership then that's a culture problem, but it doesn't have much to do with mental health.

Also, the US certainly has its fair share of issues but it's a little weird to say it's uniquely 'turmoil-stricken' compared to the UK. We have less murders or homeless people maybe, but it's not like the US is some wild west where people are just left to fend for themselves.

The shooter was definitely a student there with the rapist in the first article. Was he a victim? Maybe so. Also Being gay or trans and attending that school could have been hell. But the shooter chose now to kill….why? The GOP is taking away the rights of trans and gay people. So how does one strike back? Especially if depressed and suicidal? The politicians have too many security guards. But the kids of Republicans…they’re mostly in private Christian schools right? If you want to hurt the GOP just murder their kids. Payback for all the torture and removal of rights. Maybe the shooter thought this could make the GOP rethink what they’re doing, and back off or, if they’re still forging ahead to remove rights from people, then at least the shooter got to hurt some of them where it hurts the most before they die anyways. 

Not justifying the murders. Just wish this angle was more discussed around here bc the Christian extremists need to stop hurting the LGBTQ community. Maybe if they saw they were a big catalyst in this they would step back. If they don’t stop bullying marginalized people, especially those with serious trauma (like being raped by a church member and it being covered up by the church) I foresee more of this happening."
,antequammoriar,26,2023-03-30 13:45:22,"Apparently, there are some allegations of abuse perpetrated by the head of the schools.  It is unclear if the shooter had been abused by him but in the years when the abuse occurred, the shooter was a student there."
,psychotica1,9,2023-03-30 15:56:03,I also read those articles and won't be surprised if the shooter was one of those victims.
,kh7190,9,2023-03-30 14:24:58,Doesn’t surprise me either. Is it true that there is insurance available for religions institutions to deal with the rampant sexual misconduct of their church leaders?
,CraftsWithCats,8,2023-03-30 15:18:45,"Not an expert, but do have experience with nonprofit leadership and organizations that work with vulnerable populations. Generally, these types of organizations (churches, schools, nonprofits) have liability insurance, which covers some instances of abuse (a quick googling shows that what liability insurance covers RE abuse is often debated in the court cases, and is variable). Some insurance companies offer sexual misconduct insurance, which they market very broadly - the list there includes engineering companies, food/construction vendors who work on campuses, and more.

https://www.tmhcc.com/en-us/products/sexual-misconduct-and-molestation

So while, yes, there are deep problems with how many religious institutions fail to protect vulnerable populations and individuals, the presence of insurance policies around this isn’t necessarily a red flag - it’s a recommended business process across a variety of industries."
,kh7190,5,2023-03-30 15:24:44,Thank you for sharing this. Any statistics about how often religious institutions file sexual misconduct liability claims compared to other places?
,CraftsWithCats,2,2023-03-30 17:02:02,"Great question! Looking around online, it’s hard to find any data (and tbh, I’m not sure to what extent insurance companies are required to report on claims or to make data available, since I’m outside of that industry). Most of what I’m seeing in regards to data about sexual misconduct is EEOC reporting, in which the victims are employees, not constituents/clients/members/beneficiaries/stakeholders/etc, which is not really a useful comparison IMO (for those interested, the greatest number of EEOC sexual misconduct claims originated from the food services and accommodation industries, followed by the retail industry, with manufacturing and healthcare rounding out the top five).
 
Again, we should absolutely be concerned that churches have the level of abuse that we are seeing, but I think another important example of abuse and misconduct to look at is the Boy Scouts of America abuse settlement. The BSA’s two largest insurers were part of negotiating the settlement that was just upheld. While the BSA has strong relationships with churches (and an overall Christian alignment), they are a nonprofit organization that works with youth (according to a 2021 report by the center on nonprofits and philanthropy, 48% of nonprofits marked children and youth as one of their primary populations served). One of the things the BSA did not do well with (and similar to many churches) was having strong proactive policies in place that would restrict abuse opportunities, and enforcing those policies. Having organizational policies like always requiring at least two adults present (and especially having no one-on-one interactions), meeting in open rooms/visible spaces, etc - along with monitoring/oversight/enforcement of those policies, are good measures of how attentive an organization is protecting children/youth/vulnerable adults. 
 
An interesting side bar on abuse in religious spaces specifically: There are some denominations where the larger body has adopted specific practices that the individual congregations are expected to follow (I know the Episcopal and United Methodist denominations have existing policies). When churches are independent of a denomination (most evangelical churches), or belong to a denomination with very little governance(southern baptists), there is generally less oversight, fewer expectations, and fewer resources for creating policies for protecting vulnerable populations. One very large and glaring exception to this is of course the Catholic Church, which has tight denomination oversight and used that to NOT protect people. And the SBC used what governance they have to fail abuse victims as well."

That being said, we still don't fully know the shooter's motivations or what led up to the events.  Almost everything regarding the shooter's mindset is speculation at this time (as far as I know)."
,SlightlyMadAngus,35,2023-03-30 14:32:43,"Murder is Means, Opportunity & Motive.

Means: The shooter had access to legally purchase an arsenal of firearms.

Opportunity:  The shooter's family, friends and doctors missed or underestimated the shooter's mental crises.

Motive:  I suspect this is in the unreleased manifesto.  It certainly would not surprise me if it is related to the shooter's experience of real or perceived abuse at the christian schools they attended.

I think removing any one of these three would have prevented or at least made it more difficult for the shooter to commit this heinous act.  I want changes to be made in each of these areas.  We, as a nation of people need to stop talking about it and DO SOMETHING.

- Stop the sale of all semi-automatic firearms.  ALL.  Yes, this includes not only AR/AK platform rifles, but also semi-auto sporting & hunting rifles, shotguns and pistols.  It's not the ""solution"" but it's a start.  And yes, I own firearms, including semi autos.  I'm willing to give them up to make our world better.

- Make it much easier to obtain mental health treatment.  It should be available to everyone at no cost.  We should also fund more education programs to remove the stigma of mental health issues.  This education should start early and in all schools.

- Religion should no longer be allowed to dictate the definition of ""normal"".  Any religion that preaches being LGBTQ+ is ""evil"" is committing a hate crime.  It is no different than if they were preaching that certain races or nationalities were ""evil"" or ""less intelligent"".  This is simply unacceptable and our society should no longer allow it.   

This is no way absolves the shooter.  I refuse to consider the shooter a victim.  I don't give a shit what mental anguish you went through - there is NO justification for murdering six innocent people including three children.  You aren't a victim, you're just an asshole.

Recognize the significant issues.  Work to remove those significant issues and reduce the probability of it happening again."

You think a law that they are already breaking is going to just make them hand them over? And not only this, but what does the government do? Go around knocking on peoples doors and ask for guns? It just doesn’t seem doable. And this isn’t saying I don’t think we should just give up and throw our hands up but just rather think more and come up with a solution that will really help  Discuss"

Given younger voters, shift in politics, etc., all kinds of things change. At one point someone pre-Civil War might've said it was ""too late"" for the Antebellum South to abolish slavery.

I do agree that there are practical issues. However, there are more types of solutions than confiscating guns. Merely making weapons harder to buy would be a big deal. Also, statistically, I would hazard a hypothesis that small changes in gun access would show amplified effects. Especially if we think about other conditions which lead to violence.

To me reducing availability of fire-arms seems easily doable. It only seems undoable at the extremes. The extremes seem doable over time, given small and intentional changes."
,SlightlyMadAngus,1,2023-03-30 20:40:51,"As I said, it's a start.  There are NO solutions that will guarantee all guns are removed from the street.  Waiting for such a perfect solution is pointless.  However, we can certainly stop the retail sale of all semiautomatic firearms, both new and used.  The firearms used by this shooter were purchased legally.  If they had been forced to purchase them illegally, that is another hurdle that the shooter would have needed to get over, and another opportunity for law enforcement to become involved.

As far as the existing semiauto weapons, one possible additional step is to outlaw all transactions involving semiauto firearms.  If you own one, you keep it - but you can't sell it or give it away.  If you do, you are breaking the law and the firearm is subject to seizure.  You can possess it or you can can destroy it.   

Another possible step is to outlaw the manufacture & sale of rimless cartridges AND the components for making those cartridges (brass, bullets & dies).  This would outlaw the vast majority of ammunition that is fired in semiautos, including 9mm, 10mm, .45, 5.56/.223 (used in ARs), 7.62x39 (used in AKs).  Sure, the existing ammo *could* be reloaded with existing dies, and brass for other calibers *could* be modified to use in a semiauto - but gang-bangers aren't going to have reloading presses and dies, and it is yet another huge hurdle for a mass shooter to get over.

The problem with EVERY firearm law I have ever read is that the people on the side wanting to implement the law seem to know NOTHING about firearms, and the other side is using their knowledge of firearms to make the laws useless."

SB 1440, a bill that attempts to discriminate against LGBTQ+ Tennesseans by codifying “sex” as “a person’s immutable biological sex as determined by anatomy and genetics existing at the time of birth and evidence of a person’s biological sex” throughout state code.

Earlier this month, Governor Bill Lee signed a bill that will prevent transgender youth from accessing age-appropriate, best practice medical care. The Governor also signed the country’s first ban on some drag performances in one of our country’s legendary music capitals - restricting artists’ freedom of expression and ability to entertain and perform.

So they're implementing common sense, nice to see. 

If having common sense and not wanting to sexualize children is transphobic so be it. if you're supporting drag shoes your probably a closet pädo

Given the shooter clearly prepared for while, getting those guns, deciding on a (first?) target, and planning, one would expect the plan to involve intended targets if there were a specific school-realted cause for the shooting to take place at the school (specifically, teachers who did not prevent the bullying, or former students now employed at the school)."

2. Lots of publicity
3. They were familiar with the building because they worked or schooled there.
4. Grudge against the owners or employees

The Nashville shooter didn't seem to be very well organized, this could've been a LOT worse... like Sandy Hook.

It’s absolutely circumstantial, so take it with a grain of salt, but my theory is that the shooter was one of the victims and decided to take revenge.  With horrific results.

Instead of changing people’s behavior to be more accepting, it just makes people more likely to judge the bully victims. And as a person went to high school in the early 00s right after colombine, I think the additional scrutiny on bullied kids is horrible and helps no one.

I don’t think you’re victim blaming, btw. I think you’re seeing the rise in transphobia, particularly from religious institutions, and I think you’re concerned for the majority non-violent queer people under attack. But I think it’s important to separate discrimination as it’s unique issue.

On the other hand, information has been released that the shooter also considered a mall and another school, but abandoned those plans because of security. It's also a fact that Nashville Public Schools have a resource officer on-site for security but this particular private school did not.

It could easily be that the shooter selected the softest target available out of a variety of options and none of it had to do with Christian hate. He did quite a bit of research and planning beforehand and it doesn't appear (as of now) that he was on any particular mission to kill Christians.

But lets say that they weren't bullied directly while in the school, let's say that they were in the closet because Bible Belt Christian school. They were still probably told people like them were going to hell and were and abomination against god. Then, after graduation and after transitioning and coming out, the state keeps passing more and more restrictive laws against the LGBTQ community, but especially against transgender people, to the point where it is illegal to even provide gender affirming healthcare like hormone treatments and counseling.

From what we know, Aiden actually cased at least one other location, the local mall, but chose not to go there because there was too much security. Aiden may not have had a grudge on the school at all, but society in general. Without a manifesto, we just don't know.

The question is what role religious dogma may have played in contributing to the incident.  It hasn't been proven in this case.

But we do know that religious dogma has caused a lot of human suffering.  Gay and trans kids are subjected to harassment and ostracism because of religious hangups about human sexuality.

Sexual abuse and pedophilia happen across society.  But when such things are done by ministers and priests it brings in multiple layers of hypocrisy.  They are people who are trying to set rules for everyone else to live by, but they do not even follow the rules themselves.  Then, when they get caught, they want to play the get-out-of-jail card and say that Jesus forgives them, so their victims (and the jury) should forgive them as well."

The villain's are the terrible evil bitch of a shooter and the people who use a religion to justify terrible acts of violence and or justify treating a group of people bad. and it Isn't just Christians that vote against much of the 1900s stuff your brining up ( I know much of it has resurfaced but no one is voting against minority voting ) what's crazy is people specifically target Christianity as if Islam or Judaism or even atheist don't do this stuff as well.

No idea what reality you're living in that this would be the case. This isn't a criminal versus lawful gun owner issue. There are people who identify themselves by the existence of the 2nd amendment and while they may be law abiding now they absolutely would not cede that to the government at all. 

Not saying no would but to act like all the current law abiding gun owners would even begrudgingly turn in their guns is outright wrong. It's a major platform point of the GOP *against* Democrats that they're coming for your guns...

I agree with all of those things! Where is the GOP on prioritizing mental health? Or beefing up red flag laws? They certainly aren't doing a lot to support those initiatives. 

I'm so sick of having this same argument every time this happens, every time. I shouldn't be able to use the words 'every time' when talking about mass shootings. My comment doesn't say one thing about gun regulation, yet many of the replies people are assuming that's what I mean. 

We can't have a conversation talking about genuine actionable things we can do, as a society, to stop these because everyone gets pissed when you point out thoughts and prayers aren't working. They fucking aren't working!!! Our government has done nothing to stop mass shootings over the past 25 years, yet you want to come at me like I'm a problem? 

There's more than one thing that needs to happen to stop mass shootings."
,SleptWithYourGirl,1,2023-03-29 13:30:32,"So what would you suggest because the only two suggestions that the gun control movement has suggested is banning specific types of weapons, or severe restriction of the second, which is pretty much the same thing. So either way in some form or fashion at some level, you are banning guns. You might not be screaming from the rooftops like Beto that you wanna take the A.R. 15 but nonetheless you’re doing the essential same thing

Yes, I agree. We need to prioritize mental health, and I think that there was a certain level of corruption in our government which prevents it from happening. I think that some gun laws, such as red flag laws are useful, but the restriction of open carry, the restriction of license to carry permits and restriction of permit less carry is counterproductive. The stigma around a person, carrying a firearm and all the things I stated contribute to the problem.

Republicans and second amendment supporters are just sick of this crap as you are. But the answer is not restricted the rights of our law-abiding citizens. The answer is to fix mental health, the answer is to reform our medical system and healthcare system. The answers to provide easy access to mental health care for both men and women, and release the stigma around getting mental health help. A lot of people don’t get mental health help because they’re worried about the insurance bill or something like that. I know I’ve been in a position before but we need to fix that before we can worry about fixing anything else."
,victrasuva,1,2023-03-29 13:39:09,"Here's a comment I made earlier in this thread about reducing the number of gun deaths. I've made a few edits to be more specific to our conversation.

I do think there are things that can be done to curb gun violence. Some we've already said, like finding a way for people who are going through a mental health crisis to not have access and to get the mental health support they need. That would take more than government regulation.... really lots of community effort. 

The biggest issue I have with the gun debate is we all seem to act like gun regulation would solve all gun violence. I don't think that's true. We need to break out gun violence into sections and look for specific solutions. Like urban centers, economic investment would help curb some of that violence. 

Missouri has a huge problem with veteran suicide. I'm glad our legislature has started working on ways to support our veterans to try to lower the suicide rate. Suicide attempts are more successful if there is a gun available to that person. Who is going to support banning veterans from having guns? No one or hardly anyone. The solution for these gun deaths is not regulation, but better support for our veterans at all levels. Missouri legislature is working on that and I support it. 

Domestic violence, well red flag laws banning abusers from owning firearms would help to curb those deaths. That's a gun regulation I do support. 

Now, some of the saddest gun deaths to me....the accidental deaths that happen when an adult leaves their gun out and a kid shoots it. I hate those stories because those are so preventable. That's something the gun community should keep having awareness campaigns about, gentle reminders in the community to lock up the guns. It's a small amount of gun deaths, but it just gets me every time. 

Mass shootings, I genuinely don't know what the solution is though I know it will take all of us to stop fighting about it and start having real discussions. Maybe it's required training, focusing on safety and what to do if you're having a mental health crisis, before allowing people to own certain types of guns. I don't know the answer. 

It's not just one solution, but many things that need to happen to really make a dent in the number of gun deaths every year."
,SleptWithYourGirl,2,2023-03-29 13:41:05,"I’ll eat my words, and I don’t say that often. I HIGHLY respect your opinions on the gun matter. The most logical answer I have seen. I agree 100000%. If I had a award to give you I would. This needs to be front page"
,victrasuva,1,2023-03-29 13:48:37,"Lol, it's cool. I've gotten to this place with my opinions by eating my words many times. I was one of those people who wanted guns banned at one point. After years of reading and listening....I've realized I don't know enough about guns or current gun laws to scream about banning guns. I've learned to focus on the things I do know more about and try my best to have genuine conversations about what we really can do.

Someone else here said gun culture is a part of US culture. It's true! I have lots of friends who are very responsible gun owners, the type that are usually carrying though people never know. We as a country haven't figured out how to safely live with our gun culture and we need to start including everyone in the conversation to figure it out. 

We need to start demanding real action be taken, instead of fighting about the 2nd amendment. I believe we can do it as a society, it's going to take all of us. We need the gun community to be involved in the conversation for solutions because there's more than one solution to all different types of gun violence. We need mental health professionals, we need gun experts, we need teachers, survivors, police.... literally everyone needs to be part of this."

I completely understand that. Yes we do need some gun laws red flag laws are great background checks are great. I believe those are parts of responsible gun ownership, but gun free zones that do nothing but limits rights for a law-abiding citizens to carry their firearms will only hurt us even more, but again I apologize I did not know that that was your opinion and honestly, I believe that it is the opinion many others should have in this situation of tragedy

How many school shootings have gone by with ZERO action to stop them? You say it’s a mental health issue but do you support an overhaul of our broken healthcare system to address deficiencies in mental healthcare access? You say it’s mental health but do you support tighter restrictions on who can get guns or even just a country-wide process to background checks and waiting periods for purchasing a gun, without loopholes? You say hate crimes are tragedies but do you condemn the incitement of hate crimes that AREN’T against the Christian religion? 

If your answer to any of those is no (ahem, Josh Hawley) then shut the hell up. You don’t care about keeping kids safe you care about politics. 

And before a certain few users on this thread come for me, don’t. I’m done with this shit. Don’t support politicians who claim to care about kids and do nothing - NOTHING - to make any changes. And do not suggest arming teachers - they don’t get paid enough for what they do in the first place. Plus this was a private school so that argument has no place.

How to stop guns from shooting schools? Make them disappear, like magic. Much like how we made drugs disappear from schools. And bullying. Oh and violent beat-downs with fists. 

Oh, damn. I forgot - we didn't have enough magic to make any of those disappear. Will somebody just something something a solution? Make it go away with some kind of something! Cookies? Hugs? 🤔

Arming teachers that are willing to do so or paid security is one of the SEVERAL options that makes sense. A shooter walks in, all the school can do is hide. Shoot. Back. Not many commit suicide by shooting up a police station. Wonder why?🤔

I do agree that assault rifle regulations are also necessary - no one under 25. Waiting periods. Et cetera. But making it a bit harder to get doesn't make ARs disappear. Not do knives disappear. Handguns continue to exist. Pressure cookers can still go boom. IEDs. 

Are you suggesting that we just need to ban children dying from ARs - but handguns and explosives are acceptable? 🤯🫣

I am replying to that simple statement with answerS based in reality. I covered all of the most viable solutions. Yes, all of them. Why? 🤔 Because all solutions except the one you want to throw out ASAP have flaws. The one you threw out helps to cover those flaws by giving another level of protection. 

I also want to add that if you are totally uneducated on the topic, you probably shouldn't weigh in. If you're scratching your head about why I brought up ""making guns disappear"" then you need to review about 10 years worth of reactions to school shootings. Shouting at the sky with your hands up asking for ""something"" isn't productive. Think about real solutions. What can be done. Looking to the sky to save you isn't going to produce results. Address the solutions available. Think about your lop-sided opinions. 

Some teachers may actually want to be able to protect the children. They may be comfortable and educated with guns. They may be willing to take that responsibility. But you've tossed it out on ""their behalf"" because you know what ALL teachers think."

Yes some people are, but you came to reply to my comment assuming I was one of those people so you should really go internet-yell at someone who DOES hold that opinion. 

And of course you also suggest that I think I’m speaking for all teachers which is a huge reach, when the basis of that statement was that teachers already don’t get paid enough for what they do so the responsibility shouldn’t immediately fall on them. Which is an opinion I hold, just like a lot of anything that is being said here because no one can truly say what will work to even help this problem a little bit since nothing has been done to really try.

More accessible mental health only helps those that decide to get help. Plus, seeing a psychiatrist doesn't automatically mean 100% prevention. Especially if the source of the problem isn't or cannot be addressed.

Look! I just ""opinioned"" out your suggestions. Guess we can't do anything after all because I already know the answers. 🤷

You quite literally just doubled down, on a strawman at that. No one is suggesting train all teachers in lethal combat. That's ignorant.

Careless sharing of terribly formed opinions has consequences. You're crying that no one will do anything because people are sharing ignorant opinions to lawmakers. 

Care to guess why nothing has been done about school shootings? It's not the lawmakers - it's the ignorant and polarized opinions of the masses. Their opinions are mostly trash because they aren't qualified in forming a valid opinion. By shouting your bad opinion on the internet, you influence thousands to form the same ignorant opinion.

The fact that these types of killings are becoming more common both in the U.S. and worldwide directly coincides with the access to internet based social media platforms. The reason for this is simple, people don't arrive at this point alone, they have to be radicalized by persistent exposure to hatred. So it only stands to reason that the best way to combat radicalization is to severely limit access to social media. If we want to get serious about stopping this kind of violence I think we need to either look at banning every social media platform or accept that radicalization is a very negative consequence of it's prevalence in our society. We as a nation need to decide if freedom of speech is more important or if we need some common sense controls on how people can communicate via social media."

There are zero credible studies that prove a link between banning people's right to defend themselves and reduced rates of violence.  In fact, most show that limiting people's ability to defend themselves increases the severity of the violent crime.  That's why mass shooters, often who have obtained weapons illegally, target gun-free zones.  Then you have the uptick in urban violence that was been driven almost exclusively by social media.  Did you know the Chicago PD has a task force devoted exclusively to engaging young people who are using social media to coordinate violent crime and attempt to use that same social media to convince them not to kill?

,CorpMuffin,1,2023-03-28 18:46:33,Are you actually serious? Your claim is that the only way to reduce gun violence is to restrict social media. All three articles you just provided show a link between introduction of gun control laws and a reduction in violent crime involving guns. Your own research didn't support your point and in fact advocates for more gun control.
,Ozarkafterdark,1,2023-03-28 19:10:21,"No, I claim that the only way to reduce spree killings where children are targeted in gun-free zones for media attention is to restrict or ban social media. Violent crime that is based on other types of criminal intent like drug turf wars, domestic violence, and other types of violence between people who know each other is unlikely to be affected by any laws. That type of violent crime happens everywhere in the world at rates similar to the U.S. and there isn't much you can do about it other than reduce population density which isn't a very practical solution. 

This is a complicated issue and you have to be able to understand the statistical analysis and the differences between correlation and causation to really understand.  For all types of crime, you have to address the motivation for the violent act, not the implement used. The banning of guns in Australia is a good example of this.  Overall violent crime was completely unaffected by the ban, with the average yearly change remaining on the same statistical trend from 1990 (pre-ban) to the present.  You could even make the case that violent crime increased immediately after the ban although it's hard to control for other factors. Crime rates are available at Macrotrends and several other statistics websites. I encourage you to educate yourself on this issue if you are truly interested in learning the truth."

,Ozarkafterdark,1,2023-03-28 19:20:57,I didn't really expect to find many open minds here. These interactions have really proven how inoculated so many people on social media are against the truth. I suppose that's why it's so dangerous and so useful for people who want to spread hate and radicalize susceptible people. It's really disheartening to see so many people parroting media talking points instead of opening their minds. Some of the problem is probably that social media attracts people who place social acceptance above objective truth.  It's really a problem for society.

Radicalization happens via social media and the extreme rise in social media usage directly correlates with the rise in mass shootings. The Clinton AWB had no effect on mass shootings whatsoever or gun violence in general. That's an urban legend perpetuated by political hacks and isn't supported by studies from any serious law enforcement agencies. It didn't even ban the most used commonly used gun in mass shootings, low-capacity handguns.  Plus it was long before the spike in mass shootings which started in 2017. You just have to educate yourself and follow the science.

[https://www.theviolenceproject.org/mass-shooter-database/](https://www.theviolenceproject.org/mass-shooter-database/)

I think regulating access to social media is well within the President's executive powers. It didn't even exist when the Constitution was written. There's no way the authors of the Constitution could have predicted how harmful it could be to children. 

I'd also like to see a full investigation into the social media history of all of the mass shooters.  There need to be lawsuits against the media outlets that facilitated the radicalization of these murderers. Maybe if they get hit with a few billion-dollar lawsuits Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, TikTok, and Reddit will wake up and realize the harm they are doing."
,SLCPDTunnelDivision,1,2023-03-28 17:54:08,"its easy for you to blame others than recognize the insane ease of the mentally deranged to get ahold of your favorite toy. these types of guns weren't even around when the constitution was written. there was no way that the authors could have predicted that guns would be the number one cause of death amongst children

there have been plenty of studies that show assault weapon bans work (https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/11/25/opinion/assault-weapons-bans-work-more-states-should-try-them/). 

so if you dont want crazies to shoot up people, then dont provide such easy access to them."
,Ozarkafterdark,-1,2023-03-28 18:06:21,"That's a political editorial on a left-wing news site.  You might as well be posting Russian propaganda. Spreading lies on the internet is contributing to the radicalization of Americans and if you can't stop yourself surely you recognize the government needs to step in and do it. 

There are no credible studies that prove there is any correlation between gun bans and decreased violent crime rates, but the rise in social media access and the rise in mass murders have an almost perfect correlation. 

I know it's hard to set aside the political propaganda you have been imbibing for probably years via social media but if you just set all that aside and take a rational look at the direct links between online radicalization and mass shootings you will understand. The FBI has numerous full-time task forces focused on identifying people in the process of being radicalized via the internet and stopping them before they can act.  But that can only do so much.  I'd like to think background checks for social media users, waiting limits for new accounts, and bans of certain dangerous types of social media would work but you and I both know the criminals will find a way around all that.  What we need is an outright ban before more innocent people are killed by senseless online radicalization."

From what little info there was, it seems as if this attack was personal not general. Hate crimes are general - targeting an individual or group because of their group identity, not targeting a group because of a personal grudge against that very particular group. Or am I confused about that? It just seems to me if I targeted say a Mormon temple because there's Mormons inside, that's a hate crime. But if I target my old temple because I perceive them as the specific villains in our shared history and want to right a personal wrong, that's not a hate crime."

Could it be a targeted hate crime? Absolutely. He could have absolutely targeted the school because he despised Christians and the other targets could have been Christian businesses, Christian schools, or churches.

Is it possible the school was chosen specifically because it was the softest target? Also entirely possible.

Is it possible the school was chosen because the shooter reviled that particular institution from his time as a student and it being a Christian facility wasn't the deciding factor? Also entirely possible.

Is it possible he had a mental break and this was a protracted suicide-by-cop while also being a huge fuck you to the community? Yeah. I can't think of a more heinous way of creating a wound that can't be healed than targeting children.

Early reports stated that the shooter was a former student. They could've targeted the school for any number of reasons if they'd attended. 

Correlation is not causation. Or are you ready to admit that any time a mass murder happens it should be given total extrapolation? Was Sandy Hook a hate crime against kids? Was the Boston Marathon bombing a hate crime against runners?

Your logic test fails and it is YOUR ego that needs to be checked. Unless you are willing to jump to the same conclusion when minorities and marginalized people are the victims, we're gonna need you to chill out and let the evidence represent the reality."
,donkeyrocket,4,2023-03-28 15:12:52,"> Does it need to explicitly say that I hate Christians?

By definition a hate crime needs to be pretty clearly defined as targeting an individual or group based on them identifying with or being a part of a protected class. 

The shooter targeting their former school because they hated it there doesn't immediately make it a hate crime. The shooter targeting their former school because they hated it there *and* because they are Christians is a hate crime.

Do you believe the school shooting in St. Louis at CVPA was a hate crime? Majority of students there are Black."
,patrickandhenry1799,2,2023-03-28 15:15:37,Hmm.

Because I guarantee you many probably regret more than you may think. I’m sure some of them are amazing people, but you can’t completely disregard how others may feel about for example biological men in women’s sports. Create your own team for all I care bc then it handles both concerns. Bathrooms? Separate ones. Many women have an issue being told birthgiver is the new term, pregnancy is more than just women and they say misogyny which I have to agree with on many points. Pregnancy is biologically revolved around females. So in the process of trying to include trans you exclude others. Come up with your term.

a trans man is a man that can give birth since their sex is female. birthing person just encapsulates more people. no one is excluding you when they say birthing people. are you not a people? if you don't want to call a trans woman a her, then why should a trans women respect your gender identity? 

there are trans men in body building competitions and no one cares. i dont care if a trans man is using the mens bathroom or that there are tampons in there. theyre just going to the bathroom.

Among advanced developed countries, the United States has the highest homicide rate: 7.8 per 100,000 population in 2020. Most others, including Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom, have homicide rates that are a fraction of this level (Figure 1).

You are reaaaalllly hoping this was a hate crime and not a bully or mental health situation. That's pretty gross.

It's important to point out that there has been more murders committed by trans people in the past 3 days than January 6th and Charlottesville COMBINED... It's not ""White cis het males"" that are the problem."

Btw, None of your links support your claim for a variety of reasons. only one is credible, and it goes out of its way to specify that it is not a call to violence, which if you have forgotten is the opposite of your claim.

But I always think back to the phrase “hurt people hurt people”. There is no evidence of what I’m about to say. It is merely a theory. And more evidence may yet come to light. But there are many groups around the country, quite often religious ones, that are largely transphobic and/or anti-trans. Perhaps Hale, identifying as trans, had a shitty experience in school because of this. 

I know that in areas where islamophobia is greater, possibility of young Muslims being radicalised is higher. That idea that hurt people hurt people. We don’t know much about this school at this moment. But perhaps Hale had a similar motive. If you’re constantly hated on, things can often break with you mentally. You may just want to retaliate.

,victrasuva,4,2023-03-28 15:22:54,">Should we not address the core issue of the problem?

Absolutely! Let's address the core issue. Why would a trans person be motivated in the current climate to shoot up a Christian school? It certainly might have been a hate crime. But, where did that hatred start? Who can you think of that's breeding that type of hate?

Why was someone who is struggling this much able to access a gun at all? All questions that we should be looking at and trying to solve."
,patrickandhenry1799,4,2023-03-28 15:26:27,"I agree 100%.

Someone who's taking mine altering drugs, hormones are mind altering, should probably go through some sort of a process to determine whether or not they can own a firearm legally.

However, you are implying here that mean words towards this individual drove them to shoot up a school. The action of killing kids is not, is not justified because of someone saying mean words."

I agree that it's not justified and that is not what I meant. As an ally and a woman who is watching my rights being stripped away.... My instinct certainly is not to shoot a person. I'm not saying those children or adults deserve to be killed or that they personally are to blame! That's not true. 

But, we can't ignore the fact that less than 1% of the population is being targeted and the hate towards them is spreading. Is it any wonder someone going through such a tough period cracked? And then, as you said they were able to access a gun! Why? 

Sadly, if it wasn't this shooter it would have been someone else. Mass shootings and school shootings have been happening for way too long in this country. For Hawley to try to make a moral stance now is laughable. He didn't give a shit before, but he cares now because it's convenient and fits his agenda as a 'Christian'. He doesn't care enough to stand up to his party about spreading their hatred. He doesn't care enough to stand up to the insurance lobbyist, by working to give people access to mental health care.

,victrasuva,2,2023-03-28 15:54:51,">Well, I hate to break it to you but there is a way for Americans to coexist with firearms. Most of all gun violence happens in urban centers.

I'm down to have a discussion on how to stop gun violence in urban centers. That would take government investment in those areas, economically. Too bad the GOP votes against almost all economic investment at the federal level. There are lots of actions that can be taken to curb gun violence that have nothing to do with gun regulations. I agree, that all different types of gun violence will have different solutions. 

I agree that there is a way for Americans to exist with firearms. But, we haven't figured out how to yet. We need real discussions on what can be done... instead of the nothing that is happening now. 

What does the CRA, Community reinvestment Act, that regulates banks have to do with shootings? Are you talking about a different act?

[Tennessee Bans Gender Affirming Care for Youth](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/tennessee-bans-gender-affirming-care-for-transgender-youth)

,patrickandhenry1799,1,2023-03-28 16:04:54,"Open discussions are great. There is likely a solution that will not trample second amendment rights but also pulls the veil back and allows certain individuals to be blocked from owning deadly weapons. I agree that something needs to change but I will say that options are slim considering the right to beat arms is not supposed to be infringed. In the eyes of a gun owner, myself, I think there is a mighty lot of infringing that has happened ever since the National Firearms Act and many other executive orders to include Trump and Regan. 

I also understand that people through various nefarious ways obtain Firearms illegally and use them for evil. I'm not sure how to keep those weapons out of the hands of bad people though without taking them from those like myself that can and will own them responsibly.

Almost every solution I have heard or read in the past few years would require changes that only effect people like myself all the while, criminals in general still do what they do, crime. It's hard to understand a solution that does not include collateral damage  on responsible people.

Is there a solution that you think would work better than others? I'm curious if you are a gun owner yourself?"
,victrasuva,1,2023-03-28 16:23:30,"To start, I am not a gun owner. I don't have the safety training that I believe is necessary to be a responsible gun owner. That's my choice, as I prioritize spending money and time on other things. I do have lots of friends/family that are responsible gun owners. I support their right to own guns.

So, truly when it comes to blanket gun restrictions I struggle to be part of the conversation. I end up listening more than anything, after years of listening and learning I don't know enough about guns. 

I do think there are things that can be done to curb gun violence. Some we've already said, like finding a way for people who are going through a mental health crisis to not have access and to get the mental health support they need. That would take more than government regulation.... really lots of community effort. 

The biggest issue I have with the gun debate is we all seem to act like gun regulation would solve all gun violence. I don't think that's true. We need to break out gun violence into sections and look for specific solutions. Like how you mentioned urban centers, economic investment would help curb some of that violence. 

Missouri has a huge problem with veteran suicide. I'm glad our legislature has started working on ways to support our veterans to try to lower the suicide rate. Suicide attempts are more successful if there is a gun available to that person. Who is going to support banning veterans from having guns? No one or hardly anyone. The solution for these gun deaths is not regulation, but better support for our veterans at all levels. Missouri legislature is working on that and I support it. 

Domestic violence, well red flag laws banning abusers from owning firearms would help to curb those deaths. That's a gun regulation I do support. 

Now, some of the saddest gun deaths to me....the accidental deaths that happen when an adult leaves their gun out and a kid shoots it. I hate those stories because those are so preventable. That's something the gun community should keep having awareness campaigns about, gentle reminders in the community to lock up the guns. It's a small amount of gun deaths, but it just gets me everytime. 

It's not just one solution, but many things that need to happen to really make a dent in the number of gun deaths every year."
